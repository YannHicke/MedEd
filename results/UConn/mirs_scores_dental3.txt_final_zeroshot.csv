OPENING,2,"The physician uses the patient's name ('Hey, Kevin') but does not introduce themselves, clarify their role, or inquire how to address the patient. The conversation starts with a basic greeting and familiarity, but it lacks the formal elements of a proper introduction. Therefore, the score is 2, as the introduction is missing three key elements and only a basic greeting is present."
ELICITS SPECTRUM OF CONCERNS,4,"The medical student did a commendable job of eliciting the patient's chief complaint and secondary concerns within the first 3-5 minutes of the interview. The student asked about the patient's general well-being, oral hygiene, and any recent health issues. For instance, the student inquired, 'Have you been having any problems since you were last here for your last visit?' and 'How about your general health? Have there been any changes in your health since you were last here?' This led to the patient revealing issues like occasional gum bleeding, shortness of breath, and a recent episode of bronchitis. However, the student did not ask a final 'Anything else?' or an equivalent question to ensure all concerns were raised, which is why the score is a 4 instead of a 5."
ELICITING THE NARRATIVE THREAD or the PATIENT_S STORY,2,"The physician primarily conducted the interview in a Q&A style, which limited the patient's ability to freely narrate their story. While the physician did ask open-ended questions initially, such as 'How's everything going for you?' and 'Have you been having any problems since you were last here for your last visit?', the conversation quickly shifted to a more structured format with the physician asking specific questions and the patient providing brief answers. For example, the physician asked, 'How often have you been brushing?' and 'Have you seen your physician recently?', which are focused questions that guide the conversation rather than allowing the patient to elaborate on their own. Additionally, the physician introduced new information frequently, such as discussing the benefits of quitting smoking and various cessation methods, which further directed the conversation away from the patient's narrative. Overall, the physician did not create a conversational environment that encouraged the patient to freely discuss their concerns and experiences."
TIMELINE,2,"The medical student obtained limited information about the chronology of the chief complaint and history of the present illness. Significant gaps exist in the timeline, and the chronology of most associated symptoms is not established. The student did not delve deeply into the timeline of the patient's symptoms. For example, the patient mentioned 'occasional bleeding of the gums' and 'a few weeks ago I had an episode of bronchitis,' but the student did not ask for specific dates or durations for these symptoms. Additionally, the student did not explore the timeline of the patient's shortness of breath in detail, such as when it started, how long it lasts, or if it has been getting worse. The conversation focused more on the patient's smoking habits and plans to quit rather than establishing a detailed chronology of the present illness."
ORGANIZATION,5,"The medical student demonstrated excellent organization throughout the interview. The conversation began with a friendly greeting and a brief personal update, which helped build rapport. The student then smoothly transitioned into updating the patient's medical history, addressing oral hygiene, general health, and specific symptoms like shortness of breath. The discussion about smoking cessation was thorough and logically structured, covering the patient's smoking habits, previous quit attempts, available cessation methods, and strategies for dealing with cravings. The student also provided practical advice and support, ensuring the patient felt prepared and motivated to quit smoking. The interview flowed seamlessly, with no noticeable jumps between topics, and time was used effectively to cover all necessary points. For example, the student said, 'Before Kathy comes in to do your prophy, I wanted to just update your history,' which clearly signaled a transition to the medical history update. The detailed discussion about smoking cessation products and strategies was well-organized and comprehensive, demonstrating excellent time management and logical flow."
TRANSITIONAL STATEMENTS,Not scored,Not in mapping_items_to_score
QUESTIONING SKILLS TYPES OF QUESTIONS,3,"The physician begins the conversation with an open-ended question, 'How's everything going for you?' which is a good start. However, the physician often follows up with more specific or direct questions rather than continuing with open-ended questions. For example, 'Have you and your wife thought about any names yet for the baby?' and 'Have you been having any problems since you were last here for your last visit?' are specific questions. The physician also uses a few leading questions, such as 'And your wife is on you to quit also?' and 'Do you think you would want to quit, do you think?' Additionally, there is a 'why' question: 'Why do you think that happened?' when discussing the patient's previous attempts to quit smoking. These elements indicate that while the physician does use some open-ended questions, they often rely on specific or direct questions and occasionally use poor question types, which aligns with a score of 3."
QUESTIONING SKILLS SUMMARIZING,1,"The physician did not summarize the data obtained at any point during the interview. The conversation flowed continuously without any clear summarization of the patient's history, symptoms, or concerns. For example, after discussing the patient's oral hygiene and general health, the physician did not summarize the key points before moving on to the next topic. Similarly, after discussing the patient's smoking habits and desire to quit, there was no summarization to ensure all information was accurately captured and understood. The physician's approach lacked the necessary summarization to verify and clarify the information gathered, which is essential for a complete and accurate patient history."
QUESTIONING SKILLS DUPLICATION,4,"The medical student generally avoids repeating questions unnecessarily and maintains a good flow throughout the interview. However, there are a few instances where questions are repeated, though they seem to be for clarification or to ensure thoroughness. For example, the physician asks, 'Have you been having any problems since you were last here for your last visit?' and then later asks, 'How about your general health? Have there been any changes in your health since you were last here?' These questions are similar but serve to cover different aspects of the patient's health. Additionally, the physician repeats, 'Do you think at this point that you're willing to set an actual quit date, say, within the next month?' and 'Would that be a reasonable time frame for you?' which are closely related but aim to confirm the patient's commitment. Overall, the repetition is minimal and seems to be for clarification, justifying a score of 4."
QUESTIONING SKILLS LACK OF JARGON,4,"The medical student generally uses language that is easily understood and avoids excessive medical jargon. For example, the student uses terms like 'shortness of breath' instead of 'dyspnea' and 'tobacco stains' instead of 'nicotine-induced discoloration.' However, there are instances where medical terms are used without immediate explanation. For instance, the term 'prophy' is used without clarification, which might not be immediately understood by the patient. Additionally, terms like 'bronchitis' and 'risk factor' are used without immediate layman explanations. Despite these minor lapses, the student mostly defines terms when necessary and uses language appropriate to the patient's level of education."
QUESTIONING SKILLS VERIFICATION OF PATIENT INFORMATION,Not scored,Not in mapping_items_to_score
VERBAL FACILITATION SKILLS,4,"The medical student frequently uses facilitation skills throughout the interview, but there are a few missed opportunities and some areas where the application could be more effective. The student provides verbal encouragement and uses short statements and echoing, but not as consistently as in a top performance. For example, the student echoes the patient's concerns and provides encouragement: 'That's fantastic. Congratulations.' and 'That's great. And your wife is on you to quit also?' However, there are moments where the student could have provided more timely or specific encouragement, such as when the patient mentions the stress of quitting smoking. Overall, the student demonstrates a strong use of facilitation skills but falls short of the highest level of consistency and effectiveness."
EMPATHY AND ACKNOWLEDGING PATIENT CUES,5,"The physician consistently demonstrates empathy and acknowledges the patient's emotions and concerns throughout the interview. The physician uses supportive comments and NURS techniques effectively. For example, when the patient shares the news about expecting a baby, the physician responds with, 'That's fantastic. Congratulations,' and later adds, 'I've known you a long time, Kevin, so I have no doubt you're going to be a great dad.' This shows understanding and respect for the patient's experience. Additionally, the physician acknowledges the patient's efforts to quit smoking and provides encouragement, saying, 'That's great. That's fantastic,' and 'Well, that's great. And your wife is on you to quit also?' The physician also offers practical advice and support, such as suggesting distractions for cravings and emphasizing the importance of a support system. Overall, the physician's approach is empathetic, supportive, and patient-centered, warranting a score of 5."
PATIENTS PERSPECTIVE & BELIEFS,2,"The physician makes limited attempts to elicit the patient's perspective on their illness and healing practices. While the physician does address the patient's smoking habits and provides extensive information on quitting, they do not deeply explore the patient's Feelings, Ideas, Function, and Expectations (FIFE) regarding their health and smoking. For example, the physician does not ask about the patient's feelings towards their shortness of breath or bronchitis, nor do they explore the patient's ideas about the cause of these symptoms. The physician also does not inquire about how these symptoms impact the patient's daily function or what the patient expects from treatment. The conversation is more focused on providing information rather than understanding the patient's perspective. Quotes to support this include: 'Have you been having any problems since you were last here for your last visit?' and 'Do you have any suggestions as to how to do that? Because I'm anticipating some really strong ones.' These show some awareness of the patient's viewpoint but lack depth in exploring the patient's beliefs and experiences."
IMPACT OF ILLNESS ON PATIENT AND PATIENT_S SELF-IMAGE,Not scored,Not in mapping_items_to_score
SUPPORT SYSTEMS,4,"The medical student did a commendable job in exploring the patient's support systems, particularly in the context of smoking cessation. The student addressed the emotional support by discussing the patient's wife and friends: 'Do you have support?' and 'my wife doesn't smoke, so she's definitely going to be happy and helpful.' The student also touched on the financial aspect by discussing the cost of smoking cessation products and insurance coverage: 'Some insurance plans do cover the cost of the medications and even the nicotine replacement products.' However, the student did not delve deeply into other resources available to the patient or suggest community resources. Therefore, while the exploration was thorough in some areas, it was not comprehensive enough to warrant a score of 5."
PATIENTS EDUCATION AND UNDERSTANDING,5,"The physician demonstrated a comprehensive approach to ensuring the patient's understanding and provided thorough education throughout the interview. The physician used multiple techniques to check the patient's understanding, such as asking if the patient had any questions ('Any questions that you have at this point?'), and offering to provide additional information ('If you do have any questions after you go through the material, please make sure to give me a call.'). The physician also provided detailed explanations about the risks of smoking, the benefits of quitting, and the various cessation methods available ('You're probably already aware that it's a risk factor for a lot of significant medical problems...'). Additionally, the physician tailored the education to the patient's specific situation, such as discussing the impact of smoking on the upcoming baby and providing practical tips for dealing with cravings ('So if you're in the car driving, turn the radio on. Sing along with the radio.'). The physician also offered to follow up with the patient to support their quit attempt ('So then what I'll do is I'll plan on calling you, say, within a couple of days.'). Overall, the physician's approach was thorough, patient-centered, and supportive, meeting the criteria for a score of 5."
ASSESS MOTIVATION FOR CHANGES,5,"The physician thoroughly assessed the patient's motivation for quitting smoking and provided a comprehensive range of options and plans to support the change. The physician explored the patient's feelings about quitting, acknowledged the patient's concerns, and offered various methods to quit smoking, including medications and nicotine replacement products. The physician also discussed potential triggers and coping strategies, emphasizing the importance of a support system. For example, the physician said, 'Sometimes it's actually helpful to keep a log of when you smoke and when you get your cravings,' and 'You have to sort of anticipate in advance what your triggers are going to be, what's going to set off a craving for you, and sort of come up with a plan.' Additionally, the physician suggested setting a quit date and provided practical advice on preparing for it, such as cleaning out ashtrays and informing others about the quit attempt. This comprehensive approach aligns with the criteria for a score of 5."
ACHIEVE A SHARED PLAN,Not scored,Not in mapping_items_to_score
ENCOURAGEMENT OF QUESTIONS,4,"The physician did a commendable job of encouraging the patient to ask questions and discuss additional topics, though not consistently at the end of every major subsection. For instance, after discussing the patient's smoking habits and the potential methods for quitting, the physician asked, 'Any questions that you have at this point?' This shows a clear attempt to be open to patient input. Additionally, the physician provided opportunities for the patient to bring up concerns, such as when discussing the side effects and costs of smoking cessation products. However, the physician did not consistently encourage questions at the end of every major subsection, which is why the score is not a 5. Overall, the physician demonstrated a strong effort to be open and responsive to the patient's needs and questions."
CLOSURE,5,"The medical student clearly specifies the future plans at the end of the interview. The student outlines what they will do: 'So then what I'll do is I'll plan on calling you, say, within a couple of days.' The student also specifies what the patient will do: 'After your actual quit date, which you said is going to be two weeks from this Saturday.' Additionally, the student mentions the timing of the next communication: 'Unless I hear from you before then, if you have any questions.' The student provides a comprehensive plan and clear next steps, ensuring the patient knows what to expect moving forward."
NEGOTIATES PRIORITIES & SETS AGENDA,2,"The physician minimally negotiates priorities and fails to accomplish the complete patient agenda. Limited efforts are made to set an agenda. The physician does not explicitly list all of the patient's concerns or set a clear agenda at the onset of the interview. The conversation is more reactive to the patient's responses rather than proactively setting an agenda. For example, the physician asks, 'Have you been having any problems since you were last here for your last visit?' and 'How about your general health? Have there been any changes in your health since you were last here?' but does not follow up with a structured plan or agenda for the visit. The focus shifts to smoking cessation without a clear negotiation of other potential concerns the patient might have. The physician does not get the patient's agreement to an agenda, which is a key component of higher scores."

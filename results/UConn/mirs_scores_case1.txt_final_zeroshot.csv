OPENING,3,"The medical student introduces herself by saying, 'Hi, my name is Amy. It's nice to meet you.' and uses the patient's name, 'Hi, Mrs. Paulton?' However, she does not clarify her role or inquire how the patient prefers to be addressed. These missing elements are crucial for establishing a clear and respectful communication framework. Therefore, the score is 3, as the introduction is missing two key elements."
ELICITING THE NARRATIVE THREAD or the PATIENT_S STORY,4,"The medical student, Amy, did a commendable job of eliciting the patient's narrative thread. She encouraged the patient to talk about her problem and asked open-ended questions to gather more information. For example, she asked, 'Can you start from the beginning and really tell me everything you can remember about when it started?' and 'What did you do then? What happened next?' These questions allowed the patient to provide a detailed account of her symptoms and experiences. However, there were instances where Amy interrupted or redirected the conversation, such as when she asked, 'So it woke you up out of sleep?' and 'Can you tell me more about the pain?' These interruptions were minimal and did not significantly disrupt the patient's narrative, but they did prevent a perfect score. Overall, Amy mostly avoided introducing new information and maintained a patient-centered approach."
TIMELINE,5,"The medical student, Amy, successfully establishes a comprehensive timeline of the patient's chief complaint and history of the present illness. She begins by asking the patient to recount the episode from the beginning, which allows the patient to describe the onset of pain at around 1 AM. Amy then systematically inquires about the nature, location, and progression of the pain, including its movement to the groin area and the patient's attempts to alleviate it. She also gathers information about associated symptoms such as nausea, sweating, and urinary issues, and confirms the duration and resolution of the pain around 5 AM. Amy's questions cover the chronology of the pain and associated symptoms thoroughly, with no significant gaps in the timeline. For example, she asks, 'Can you start from the beginning and really tell me everything you can remember about when it started?' and 'How long did the pain last?' This detailed inquiry ensures that a clear chronology is established, justifying a score of 5."
ORGANIZATION,5,"The medical student, Amy, conducted the interview in a highly organized and logical manner. She began by establishing rapport and then systematically explored the patient's chief complaint, starting with the onset of the pain and its characteristics. For example, she asked, 'Can you start from the beginning and really tell me everything you can remember about when it started?' and followed up with specific questions about the pain's location, movement, and associated symptoms. Amy then transitioned smoothly into questions about the patient's medical history, medications, and family history, ensuring that all relevant information was covered. She also addressed the patient's daily life and support systems, asking, 'Can you tell me a little bit about your support systems?' The flow of the interview was logical and comprehensive, with no noticeable jumps between topics. Time was managed effectively, and all necessary tasks were completed within the interview. Therefore, a score of 5 is justified."

QUESTIONING SKILLS TYPES OF QUESTIONS,5,"The medical student consistently begins lines of inquiry with open-ended questions and follows up with more specific questions to gather detailed information. For example, the student starts with 'So what brings you in today?' and 'Can you start from the beginning and really tell me everything you can remember about when it started?' These open-ended questions allow the patient to provide a comprehensive narrative. The student then uses more specific questions to clarify details, such as 'Can you tell me more about the pain?' and 'Was there anything different about the urine that came out?' The student avoids poor question types like leading, why, or multiple questions, ensuring that the patient can provide information without being led or confused. Overall, the questioning technique is thorough, patient-centered, and effective in gathering necessary information."
QUESTIONING SKILLS SUMMARIZING,3,"The medical student made some attempts to summarize the data but did not do so consistently or completely. For example, after discussing the initial episode of pain, the student did not summarize the key points before moving on to the next set of questions. The student did provide a brief summary towards the end of the interview: 'In terms of the history, I feel like we've gotten a pretty good idea of what's going on and the symptoms that you've had.' However, this summary was incomplete and lacked detail. The student missed several opportunities to summarize after major lines of inquiry, such as after discussing the pain characteristics, urinary symptoms, and the patient's overall health and family history. Therefore, the performance aligns with a score of 3."
QUESTIONING SKILLS DUPLICATION,5,"The medical student, Amy, did not repeat questions unnecessarily throughout the interview. She asked for clarification and additional details when needed, but there was no evidence of her failing to remember previously provided information. For example, she asked about the nature of the pain and its location ('Can you tell me more about the pain? It was a tearing pain.' and 'And where was it?'), but these questions were aimed at gathering more specific details rather than duplicating information. Additionally, when discussing the patient's symptoms and history, Amy did not repeat questions but rather built on the information provided ('And while this was going on, while the pain was going on, was it constant? Did it come and go, or was it really constant for those hours?'). Overall, the flow of the interview was smooth, and there were no disruptions caused by repeated questions."
QUESTIONING SKILLS LACK OF JARGON,5,"The medical student consistently used language that was easily understood by the patient and avoided medical jargon throughout the interview. For example, instead of using medical terms like 'dysuria' or 'hematuria,' the student asked, 'Was there anything different about the urine that came out?' and 'was there any pain when you were able to pee?' The student also used simple language to describe symptoms and actions, such as 'tearing pain,' 'low on my right side of my abdomen,' and 'I tried curling up.' The student ensured clarity by asking follow-up questions in a straightforward manner, such as 'Can you tell me more about the pain?' and 'How long did the pain last?' Additionally, the student confirmed understanding and provided empathetic responses, like 'Sounds like it was a long morning for you.' Overall, the language used was appropriate to the patient's level of education, and there were no instances of unexplained medical jargon."
QUESTIONING SKILLS VERIFICATION OF PATIENT INFORMATION,4,"The medical student frequently seeks clarification, verification, and specificity of the patient's responses, demonstrating a clear pattern of following up on important details. For example, the student asks for more details about the pain ('Can you tell me more about the pain? It was a tearing pain.'), its location ('And where was it?'), and its movement ('And did it move anywhere?'). The student also verifies the patient's actions and responses to the pain ('So you tried to walk around. That didn't seem to help.' and 'Anything you did to try to help it?'). Additionally, the student clarifies the patient's symptoms and their duration ('And while this was going on, while the pain was going on, was it constant? Did it come and go, or was it really constant for those hours?'). However, there are a few minor missed opportunities for further clarification, such as not probing deeper into the patient's description of the urine color change ('Was there anything different about the urine that came out?'). Overall, the student demonstrates a strong ability to seek clarification and verification, but a few minor missed opportunities prevent a perfect score."
VERBAL FACILITATION SKILLS,4,"The medical student, Amy, frequently uses facilitation skills during the interview, but not as consistently or effectively as in a score of 5. She uses verbal encouragement and short statements to keep the patient talking, such as 'Can you tell me more about the pain?' and 'Sounds like it was a long morning for you.' She also echoes the patient's statements, like 'So it woke you up out of sleep.' However, there are a few missed opportunities where more verbal encouragement or empathy could have been shown, such as when the patient described the severity of the pain or the frustration of not being able to urinate properly. Overall, Amy demonstrates a good use of facilitation skills, but there is room for improvement in consistency and effectiveness."
EMPATHY AND ACKNOWLEDGING PATIENT CUES,3,"The medical student, Amy, maintains a neutral tone throughout the interview. She asks relevant questions and acknowledges the patient's responses, but there are limited explicit demonstrations of empathy. For example, when the patient describes the severity of her pain, Amy does not explicitly acknowledge the emotional impact of the experience. The closest she comes to showing empathy is when she says, 'Sounds like it was a long morning for you,' and 'I'm glad you have that support in your life.' These comments show some recognition of the patient's experience but lack depth. Overall, Amy's approach is professional and neutral, without significant positive or negative emphasis on empathy."

IMPACT OF ILLNESS ON PATIENT AND PATIENT_S SELF-IMAGE,2,"The medical student, Amy, makes limited attempts to address the impact of the illness on Mrs. Paulton's life or self-image. While Amy does inquire about the patient's support system and whether missing work is a problem, she does not delve deeply into how the illness has affected the patient's emotional state or self-perception. For example, Amy asks, 'Is that going to be a problem?' when discussing missing work, and 'Can you tell me a little bit about your support systems?' but does not explore further how the patient feels about these issues. No counseling or resources are offered to help the patient cope with the impact of the illness. The student shows some awareness of the importance of these issues but struggles to effectively address them or draw out the patient's feelings."
SUPPORT SYSTEMS,2,"The medical student made limited attempts to determine the patient's available support. The student briefly touched on the emotional support aspect by asking about the patient's support systems and learning that the husband is the main support system: 'Can you tell me a little bit about your support systems?' and 'I guess he's probably the main support system.' However, the student did not explore financial support or other resources available to the patient. There was no discussion about the patient's financial situation, healthcare access, or suggestions for community resources. The student shows some awareness of the importance of patient support but fails to gather comprehensive information or provide relevant suggestions."

ENCOURAGEMENT OF QUESTIONS,1,"The medical student did not provide the patient with any explicit opportunities to ask questions or discuss additional points throughout the interview. The student moved from one question to the next without pausing to check if the patient had any questions or additional information to share. For example, after discussing the patient's pain and symptoms, the student immediately transitioned to questions about the patient's overall health without inviting any questions: 'Okay. I just want to move on now and ask you some more questions about your health.' Similarly, at the end of the interview, the student concluded with 'So at this point, I think we just need to do the physical exam, see if you need any tests, and then we'll move on from there,' without asking if the patient had any questions or concerns. This lack of encouragement for patient questions or additional points justifies a score of 1."
CLOSURE,2,"The medical student makes limited attempts to specify future plans at the end of the interview. The student mentions, 'I think we just need to do the physical exam, see if you need any tests, and then we'll move on from there,' which provides some direction but is vague and incomplete. The patient is left with an unclear sense of what to expect next. The student shows some awareness of the need for closure but struggles to provide a comprehensive plan or clear next steps."
ELICITS SPECTRUM OF CONCERNS,3,"The medical student, Amy, successfully elicited detailed information about the patient's chief complaint, which was the severe abdominal pain experienced the previous night. Amy asked several follow-up questions to understand the nature, location, duration, and associated symptoms of the pain. For example, she asked, 'Can you tell me more about the pain?' and 'Any other symptoms that you felt at the same time?' However, Amy did not ask a final 'Anything else?' question or an equivalent to ensure all concerns were raised. Additionally, while she gathered comprehensive information about the chief complaint, she did not explore any secondary concerns the patient might have had. Therefore, the performance aligns with a score of 3, as the student elicited some of the patient’s concerns on their chief complaint but did not ensure all concerns were addressed."
NEGOTIATES PRIORITIES & SETS AGENDA,1,"The medical student did not negotiate the priorities or set an agenda for the visit. The student focused solely on the chief complaint, which was the patient's abdominal pain, and did not inquire about any other concerns the patient might have had. The student did not list all of the patient's concerns or set an agenda at the onset of the interview. For example, the student started with 'So what brings you in today?' and then proceeded to delve into the details of the abdominal pain without discussing or negotiating any other potential concerns or priorities the patient might have had. The conversation was driven by the physician's questions about the chief complaint and the patient's medical history, without any effort to establish a comprehensive agenda for the visit."

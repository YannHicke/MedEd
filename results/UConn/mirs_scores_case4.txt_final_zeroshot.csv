OPENING,3,"The physician introduces herself by saying, 'Hi, I'm Brianna,' and uses the patient's name, 'Hi, I'm Dan.' However, the physician does not clarify her role or inquire how the patient prefers to be addressed. Therefore, the introduction is missing two key elements, resulting in a score of 3."
ELICITING THE NARRATIVE THREAD or the PATIENT_S STORY,3,"The medical student begins to let the patient talk about their problem but frequently interrupts with focused questions and introduces new information into the conversation. For example, after the patient mentions their concern about chest pain and its impact on their job, the student immediately redirects to asking about the specifics of the chest pain: 'So I'll just ask a little bit about your chest pain, and then we'll get some information that will help me assess your risk of heart disease since it sounds like you're concerned about that, and then we'll find out a little bit about your job. Okay. Is that okay?' This pattern continues throughout the interview, with the student often steering the conversation with specific questions rather than allowing the patient to narrate their story more freely. While the student does gather comprehensive information, the approach is more Q&A style rather than a conversational flow, which aligns with a score of 3."
TIMELINE,5,"The medical student, Brianna, successfully establishes a comprehensive timeline of the patient's chief complaint and history of the present illness. She begins by identifying the onset of the chest pain ('About two nights ago'), and then explores the circumstances surrounding the onset ('I was mountain biking, and I ended up falling off and hit myself'). She further clarifies the progression of the pain ('Yesterday it was more severe, the pain. And it hasn't gone away yet'). Brianna also inquires about the nature of the pain ('It's like an aching pain that's always there'), its triggers ('there's a sharpness that will come sometimes when I move'), and alleviating factors ('I've been taking some Advil, and that's helped, and just staying still'). Additionally, she explores associated symptoms and the patient's concerns about his heart health and work. The chronology of all associated symptoms and relevant details are well established, justifying a score of 5."
ORGANIZATION,5,"The medical student, Brianna, conducted the interview in a highly organized and logical manner. She began by establishing rapport and understanding the patient's primary concerns. She then systematically addressed each concern, starting with the chest pain, followed by the patient's medical history, family history, and social history. For example, she clearly outlined the plan: 'I'll just ask a little bit about your chest pain, and then we'll get some information that will help me assess your risk of heart disease since it sounds like you're concerned about that, and then we'll find out a little bit about your job.' This approach ensured that all relevant information was gathered in a structured way. Additionally, she effectively summarized the patient's concerns and provided reassurance and a plan for further evaluation: 'So it sounds like your three main concerns today were your chest pain, your heart health, and your work.' Time was used efficiently, and the interview flowed seamlessly without any noticeable jumps between topics. Overall, Brianna's performance aligns well with the criteria for a score of 5."
TRANSITIONAL STATEMENTS,Not scored,Not in mapping_items_to_score
QUESTIONING SKILLS TYPES OF QUESTIONS,4,"The medical student, Brianna, begins the information gathering with an open-ended question: 'What brings you in today?' This is a strong start and sets the tone for the interview. Throughout the conversation, Brianna mostly uses open-ended questions to explore the patient's concerns, such as 'Why don't you tell me about when your chest pain started?' and 'Can you tell me about what the pain feels like to you?' These questions allow the patient to provide detailed information. However, there are instances where Brianna uses more specific or direct questions to gather information, such as 'Were you wearing a helmet?' and 'Do you usually mountain bike at night?' While these questions are appropriate and necessary, they do not follow the open-ended format. Additionally, Brianna occasionally uses leading questions, such as 'And do you ever feel like maybe you're drinking too much or do you feel like you're drinking just as much as other people are drinking?' This could potentially influence the patient's response. Despite these minor issues, Brianna's questioning skills are strong overall, with a good balance of open-ended and specific questions, and very few poor question types."
QUESTIONING SKILLS SUMMARIZING,5,"The medical student consistently summarizes the data obtained at the end of each major line of inquiry. For example, after discussing the patient's initial concerns, the student summarizes: 'Okay. So you're concerned about your chest pain. You're concerned about your heart. You're also concerned about your job.' This pattern continues throughout the interview. After discussing the chest pain, the student summarizes: 'So it started two nights ago when you were mountain biking and you hit your chest on the handles. And tell me how it's been since that point.' The student also provides a comprehensive summary towards the end of the interview: 'So it sounds like your three main concerns today were your chest pain, that started a couple days ago, your heart health, because you're worried that you might be at risk for heart disease because of your mom, and then also your work.' These summaries help verify and clarify the information, ensuring a complete history is obtained."
QUESTIONING SKILLS DUPLICATION,5,"The medical student, Brianna, demonstrated excellent questioning skills without unnecessary repetition. She effectively summarized and clarified information without duplicating questions. For instance, she confirmed the patient's concerns about chest pain, heart health, and job impact early in the interview and did not revisit these points unnecessarily. When discussing the chest pain, she asked about the onset, nature, and exacerbating factors without repeating questions. Additionally, she efficiently gathered the patient's medical and social history without redundancy. The only instance that might seem repetitive is when she asked the patient to remind her of his age, but this was contextually appropriate to address the patient's concern about his mother's heart surgery. Overall, Brianna maintained a smooth interview flow and avoided disrupting it with repeated questions."
QUESTIONING SKILLS LACK OF JARGON,4,"The medical student, Brianna, generally uses language that is easily understood by the patient, Dan. She avoids complex medical jargon for the most part and explains terms when necessary. For example, she uses simple language when discussing the patient's activities and symptoms: 'What were you doing at the time when your chest pain started?' and 'Can you tell me about what the pain feels like to you?' However, there are instances where she uses medical terms without immediate explanation, such as 'atherosclerosis' and 'angina,' which the patient does not understand. She does follow up with simpler questions, but there is a slight delay in defining these terms. Overall, the language used is mostly appropriate to the patient's level of education, with minor lapses."
QUESTIONING SKILLS VERIFICATION OF PATIENT INFORMATION,4,"The medical student frequently seeks clarification, verification, and specificity of the patient's responses, demonstrating a clear pattern of following up on important details. For example, the student asks about the circumstances of the chest pain onset ('What were you doing at the time when your chest pain started?'), verifies the patient's alcohol consumption ('How much had you had to drink before you rode your mountain bike?'), and explores the patient's family history of heart disease ('Do you know if she had atherosclerosis?'). However, there are a few minor missed opportunities for further clarification, such as not probing deeper into the patient's description of the pain ('It's like an aching pain that's always there') or the patient's statement about their mother's heart surgery ('Do you know what kind of heart surgery she had?'). These missed opportunities are minor and do not significantly impact the overall understanding of the patient's situation, thus warranting a score of 4."
VERBAL FACILITATION SKILLS,4,"The medical student frequently uses facilitation skills during the interview, but not as consistently or effectively as in a score of 5. The student uses verbal encouragement and short statements to keep the patient talking, such as 'Okay,' 'I see,' and 'That's good to hear.' The student also echoes the patient's concerns, like 'So you're concerned about your chest pain. You're concerned about your heart. You're also concerned about your job.' However, there are a few missed opportunities for more specific verbal encouragement or deeper exploration of the patient's feelings and concerns. For example, when the patient expresses nervousness about the chest pain and its impact on his job, the student could have provided more reassurance or explored the patient's emotional state further. Overall, the student demonstrates good facilitation skills but could improve by being more consistent and specific in their verbal encouragement."
EMPATHY AND ACKNOWLEDGING PATIENT CUES,3,"The medical student, Brianna, demonstrates a neutral level of empathy throughout the interview. She acknowledges the patient's concerns and provides appropriate responses, but there are missed opportunities for deeper empathetic engagement. For example, when the patient expresses concern about the chest pain and its impact on his job, Brianna acknowledges these concerns but does not delve deeper into the patient's emotional state or provide much reassurance beyond the factual information. She says, 'Okay. So you're concerned about your chest pain. You're concerned about your heart. You're also concerned about your job. Okay. Is there anything else you'd like to talk about today before we move on?' This shows she is listening but does not fully engage with the patient's emotional experience. Additionally, when the patient mentions being nervous about the pain and its potential impact on his heart, Brianna responds with factual information but does not offer much emotional support: 'Okay. Well, I'm glad you came in.' Overall, Brianna's approach is professional and thorough, but it lacks the depth of empathetic engagement that would warrant a higher score."

IMPACT OF ILLNESS ON PATIENT AND PATIENT_S SELF-IMAGE,3,"The medical student partially addresses the impact of the illness on the patient's life and self-image. The student acknowledges the patient's concern about how the chest pain might affect his job and offers to provide a work excuse (""Once we finish up the visit and we do the exam and get a better idea of what's causing your pain, I would be more than happy to speak with my preceptor and see if we can get a work excuse for you so you can have some recovery time.""). However, the student does not deeply explore the patient's feelings about the illness or its broader impact on his life and self-image. There is no mention of counseling or resources to help the patient cope with his concerns about heart health or the potential impact on his job. The student does show some awareness of the importance of these issues but does not effectively address them or draw out the patient's feelings in a comprehensive manner."
SUPPORT SYSTEMS,1,"The medical student did not explore the patient's support systems effectively. There was no discussion about the patient's emotional support, financial support, or other resources available to the patient and family. The conversation focused primarily on the patient's medical history, the details of the chest pain, and lifestyle factors such as alcohol consumption and smoking. There was a brief mention of the patient's job and concerns about returning to work, but this was not explored in depth in terms of support systems. Therefore, the student failed to determine what support is currently available to the patient."

ENCOURAGEMENT OF QUESTIONS,5,"The medical student consistently encouraged the patient to ask questions and bring up additional topics throughout the interview. For example, early in the conversation, the student asked, 'Is there anything else you'd like to talk about today before we move on?' This shows an openness to additional concerns. Later, the student revisited the patient's concerns about their job and offered to discuss a work excuse, saying, 'Once we finish up the visit and we do the exam and get a better idea of what's causing your pain, I would be more than happy to speak with my preceptor and see if we can get a work excuse for you so you can have some recovery time.' At the end of the interview, the student summarized the main concerns and explicitly asked, 'Do you have any questions about what we've talked about?' and 'Any other questions that you have?' This consistent encouragement for questions and additional topics throughout the interview justifies a score of 5."
CLOSURE,4,"The medical student provides a clear summary of the patient's concerns and outlines the next steps, but does not specify the timing of the next communication or appointment. The student says, 'So it sounds like your chest pain is probably related to the mountain biking accident, and we talked about getting you a note for work. And based on what I've heard from your history, it sounds like at your age and with the lifestyle you have, you're not at a terrible risk for heart disease at this time, but making some changes with cutting out alcohol and smoking, I think that that would definitely decrease your risks of heart disease in the future.' The student also mentions, 'I'll go talk with my preceptor, and you can wait here, change into a gown, and we'll be back in just a few minutes to do your physical exam.' While the student does specify what they will do next (talk with the preceptor and return for a physical exam) and what the patient should do (wait and change into a gown), the timing of the next communication or appointment is not explicitly mentioned. This results in a score of 4."
ELICITS SPECTRUM OF CONCERNS,5,"The medical student, Brianna, successfully elicited the patient's full spectrum of concerns within the first 3-5 minutes of the interview. She asked the patient, Dan, what brought him in today and followed up with 'Is there anything else that brought you in today?' to ensure all concerns were raised. Dan mentioned his chest pain, concern about his heart, and how it might impact his job. Brianna then confirmed these concerns by summarizing them and asking, 'Is there anything else you'd like to talk about today before we move on?' to which Dan responded, 'No, that's it.' This thorough approach ensured that all of Dan's concerns were addressed early in the interview."
NEGOTIATES PRIORITIES & SETS AGENDA,5,"The medical student, Brianna, fully negotiates the priorities of the patient's concerns and sets the agenda at the onset of the interview. She begins by asking, 'What brings you in today?' and follows up with, 'Is there anything else that brought you in today?' This allows the patient to express all his concerns, which include chest pain, heart health, and its impact on his job. Brianna then confirms the patient's concerns by summarizing them: 'Okay. So you're concerned about your chest pain. You're concerned about your heart. You're also concerned about your job. Okay. Is there anything else you'd like to talk about today before we move on?' This ensures that all concerns are listed. She sets the agenda by stating, 'So I'll just ask a little bit about your chest pain, and then we'll get some information that will help me assess your risk of heart disease since it sounds like you're concerned about that, and then we'll find out a little bit about your job. Okay. Is that okay?' The patient agrees, indicating that the agenda is mutually agreed upon. Throughout the interview, Brianna revisits the patient's concerns and ensures they are addressed, demonstrating a thorough and patient-centered approach."

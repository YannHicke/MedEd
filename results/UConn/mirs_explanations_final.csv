OPENING,Behavioral1,,"The medical student, Amy, successfully includes all key elements in the opening of the interview. She introduces herself ('Hi. My name is Amy.'), clarifies her role ('I'm a second-year medical student.'), inquires how to address the patient ('Mr. Smitherson, is that correct?'), and uses the patient's name ('Okay. How old are you, Tom?'). Therefore, based on the criteria, the student deserves a score of 5."
ELICITS SPECTRUM OF CONCERNS,Behavioral1,,"The medical student, Amy, successfully elicited the patient's full spectrum of concerns within the first 3-5 minutes of the interview. She began by confirming the patient's chief complaint about quitting smoking and then explicitly asked, 'So besides your concern about quitting smoking, do you have any other things that you would like to speak about today?' The patient responded, 'No. That was pretty much it.' Amy further ensured that the patient could bring up any additional concerns later by saying, 'If anything comes up, you can just stop me or just remember for later.' This approach confirms that Amy was thorough in addressing the patient's concerns and left room for any additional issues to be raised."
NEGOTIATES PRIORITIES & SETS AGENDA,Behavioral1,,"The medical student, Amy, demonstrated a thorough and effective approach to negotiating the patient's priorities and setting the agenda for the visit. She began by confirming the patient's primary concern: 'I understand you've come in today because you're interested in quitting smoking. Is that correct?' This ensured that the main issue was identified right at the start. Amy then outlined the structure of the visit: 'So I'll start off by asking you questions about your current medical history, and then your past medical history, family history, social history. Get to know what you know about smoking and its effects on your body, and then we'll go through a plan. Does that sound like a good idea?' This clear agenda-setting was agreed upon by the patient: 'That sounds good.' Additionally, Amy asked if there were any other concerns: 'So besides your concern about quitting smoking, do you have any other things that you would like to speak about today?' The patient confirmed there were no other concerns, but Amy still left room for additional issues to be raised: 'If anything comes up, you can just stop me or just remember for later. Sound good?' Throughout the interview, Amy revisited and reinforced the plan, ensuring the patient was on board and understood each step. For example, she confirmed the patient's understanding and agreement multiple times: 'Does that sound like something you would be able to do?' and 'Does that sound like a good idea?' This consistent engagement and confirmation of the patient's agreement to the agenda and plan demonstrate a high level of negotiation and patient-centered care, justifying a score of 5."
ELICITING THE NARRATIVE THREAD or the PATIENT_S STORY,Behavioral1,,"The medical student primarily conducted the interview in a Q&A style, which limited the patient's ability to freely narrate their story. The student frequently interrupted the patient with specific questions, which directed the conversation rather than allowing the patient to lead. For example, after the patient mentioned taking vitamin D for mood improvement, the student immediately asked, 'Is there a particular reason?' instead of allowing the patient to elaborate on their own. Additionally, the student often introduced new topics without fully exploring the patient's responses, such as moving quickly from the patient's father's lung cancer diagnosis to asking about other medications. This approach hindered the development of a more natural, patient-led narrative."
TIMELINE,Behavioral1,-,-
ORGANIZATION,Behavioral1,,"The medical student, Amy, demonstrated excellent organization throughout the interview. She began by introducing herself and confirming the patient's name, then clearly outlined the structure of the interview: 'So I'll start off by asking you questions about your current medical history, and then your past medical history, family history, social history. Get to know what you know about smoking and its effects on your body, and then we'll go through a plan.' This set clear expectations for the patient. Amy followed this structure closely, moving logically from current health status to past medical history, family history, and social history. She then transitioned smoothly into discussing the patient's smoking habits and motivations for quitting, before finally developing a detailed quit plan. Amy also effectively managed time, ensuring all necessary topics were covered without rushing or prolonging any section unduly. Her questions were coherent and followed a logical progression, making it easy for the patient to follow along. For example, after discussing the patient's smoking habits, she naturally moved to the patient's knowledge about smoking and its effects, and then to triggers and patterns of smoking. The interview concluded with a clear summary and a plan, ensuring the patient understood the next steps. Overall, Amy's performance aligns perfectly with the criteria for a score of 5."

The student began the conversation with an open-ended question about the patient's reason for the visit: 'I understand you've come in today because you're interested in quitting smoking. Is that correct?' However, many subsequent questions were more specific or direct, such as 'How old are you, Tom?' and 'Are there any illnesses or medical conditions that you are currently experiencing?' The student did use some open-ended questions to explore the patient's smoking habits and motivations, such as 'Have you ever considered quitting in the past, or did you ever quit in the past?' and 'What makes you think it's going to work this time around?' However, there were also instances of leading questions, such as 'So kind of like peer pressure and kind of influence?' and 'So what makes you think it's going to work this time around?' Additionally, the student asked multiple questions in a single turn, such as 'Do you have any history of, besides the smoking, do you have any history of alcohol use or recreational drug use?' Overall, the student often failed to begin lines of inquiry with open-ended questions and used a few leading and multiple questions, which aligns with a score of 3."
QUESTIONING SKILLS SUMMARIZING,Behavioral1,,"The medical student consistently summarized the data obtained at the end of each major line of inquiry, ensuring clarity and accuracy. For example, after discussing the patient's current health status and smoking habits, the student summarized: 'So you mentioned that you're taking vitamin D, and it's mostly to just help you with your mood. Is that correct?' This was confirmed by the patient. Additionally, at the end of the interview, the student provided a comprehensive summary of the plan: 'So from everything that we've discussed, I just want to make sure that I've said things clearly and that I haven't misspoke. Would you be able to repeat back the plan that we've come up with?' The patient then accurately repeated the plan, indicating that the student had effectively communicated and summarized the information. The student also summarized the patient's social history and family history accurately, ensuring no details were missed.

The student also echoed the patient's statements to show understanding, for example, 'So it's probably been tough on you in terms of your father's health history and also school.' However, there were moments where the student could have provided more specific verbal encouragement or explored the patient's feelings further. For instance, when the patient mentioned feeling low due to their father's lung cancer diagnosis, the student quickly moved on without delving deeper into the emotional impact. Overall, the student showed a good level of facilitation but could improve by being more consistent and timely with their verbal encouragement and exploration of the patient's emotions."
NON-VERBAL FACILITATION SKILLS,Behavioral1,,-
EMPATHY AND ACKNOWLEDGING PATIENT CUES,Behavioral1,,"The medical student, Amy, demonstrates a good level of empathy and acknowledges patient cues throughout the interview. She uses supportive comments and shows understanding of the patient's situation, particularly when discussing the patient's father's lung cancer diagnosis and the patient's struggles with quitting smoking. For example, she says, 'Sorry to hear about that,' and 'I'm sure it has been difficult on you and your family.' She also acknowledges the patient's concerns about financial constraints and offers practical solutions, such as discussing the Pfizer program for medication. However, there are moments where deeper empathy could have been shown, such as when the patient mentions feeling low in spirits or flunking out of college. While Amy does express some understanding, these moments could have been opportunities for more profound empathetic engagement. Overall, Amy's performance is strong, but there are occasional missed opportunities for deeper connection, which is why the score is a 4."
PATIENTS PERSPECTIVE & BELIEFS,Behavioral1,,"The medical student made some attempts to elicit the patient's perspective on their illness and beliefs, but did not fully explore all aspects of FIFE (Feelings, Ideas, Function, Expectations). The student did inquire about the patient's reasons for wanting to quit smoking, such as the father's lung cancer diagnosis and the patient's own health concerns. However, the student did not delve deeply into the patient's feelings about their smoking habit or the emotional impact of their father's illness. The student also did not explore the patient's expectations for treatment and outcomes in detail. For example, the student asked, 'So what makes you think it's going to work this time around?' but did not follow up with questions about the patient's specific expectations or hopes for the future. Additionally, while the student discussed the patient's social support and living situation, they did not fully explore how the smoking habit affects the patient's daily function or quality of life. Overall, the student showed some awareness of the importance of the patient's viewpoint but did not effectively draw out or address these beliefs and practices comprehensively."

SUPPORT SYSTEMS,Behavioral1,,"The medical student, Amy, thoroughly explored the patient's support systems across multiple dimensions. She inquired about emotional support by asking, 'So who really serves as your social support? Would you say it's your parents, or do you have friends in the area?' The patient responded that his parents are his main support system. Amy also addressed financial support by asking, 'Do you have insurance through your job?' and later discussing financial assistance programs for medication: 'Pfizer actually has a program where they can actually sponsor the prescription for you.' Additionally, she suggested community resources and strategies to help the patient quit smoking, such as using a calendar and contract, and involving his parents in his quit plan: 'So it's a really good idea to get their support in your efforts. So tell them that you're going to quit smoking, and I'm sure they'll support you considering they themselves quit smoking.' This comprehensive approach meets the criteria for a score of 5."
PATIENTS EDUCATION AND UNDERSTANDING,Behavioral1,,"The medical student, Amy, demonstrated a comprehensive approach to ensuring the patient's understanding and addressing patient education throughout the interview. She used several deliberate techniques to check the patient's understanding, such as asking the patient to repeat back the plan (e.g., 'Would you be able to repeat back the plan that we've come up with?'). Amy also asked if the patient had any questions multiple times (e.g., 'Do you have any questions at this time or any other concerns you've thought of?'). She provided detailed explanations about the effects of smoking, the medication Chantix, and strategies for quitting smoking, ensuring the patient was well-informed. Additionally, Amy assessed the patient's level of interest in education and tailored her information accordingly, such as discussing the patient's knowledge of smoking's effects and providing additional details where necessary.

The timing was also clearly specified, with a quit date set for two weeks from today and a follow-up visit scheduled in about three weeks. The student also reassured the patient about the support available and addressed additional concerns about weight gain and the effectiveness of the medication. Direct quotes supporting this include: 'So from everything that we've discussed, I just want to make sure that I've said things clearly and that I haven't misspoke. Would you be able to repeat back the plan that we've come up with?' and 'So we'll schedule a follow-up visit with Dr. Lelko when she comes in. So we look forward to seeing you in about three weeks.'"
OPENING,Behavioral2,,"The medical student, Cheyenne, successfully includes all key elements in the opening of the interview. Cheyenne introduces herself: 'I'm Cheyenne.' She clarifies her role: 'I'm a medical student. And I'm going to talk to you for a little bit before the doctor comes in, if that's okay.' She inquires how to address the patient: 'Now what would you like me to call you?' and uses the patient's name: 'Hi, Mrs. McCullough. How are you?' and later 'So how old are you, Velma?' Therefore, the student meets all the criteria for a perfect score."
ELICITS SPECTRUM OF CONCERNS,Behavioral2,,"The medical student successfully elicited the patient's full spectrum of concerns within the first 3-5 minutes of the interview. The student asked the patient what brought her into the office and followed up with 'Is there anything else that you're concerned about?' (Physician: 'So what brings you into the office today?' Patient: 'Well, I'm wanting to do something with exercise, and I'm not really sure what I want to do or why even to do it.' Physician: 'Okay. Well, then I'm glad you came in. We can certainly talk about that. Is there anything else that you're concerned about?' Patient: 'No.'). This ensured that all of the patient's concerns were addressed early in the conversation."
NEGOTIATES PRIORITIES & SETS AGENDA,Behavioral2,,"The medical student, Cheyenne, fully negotiates the priorities of the patient's concerns and sets a clear agenda at the onset of the interview.

Overall, Cheyenne demonstrates strong questioning skills with a good balance of open-ended and specific questions, justifying a score of 4."
QUESTIONING SKILLS SUMMARIZING,Behavioral2,,"The medical student consistently summarizes the data obtained at the end of each major line of inquiry, ensuring clarity and completeness of the patient's history. For example, after discussing the patient's interest in starting an exercise program and her medical history, the student summarizes: 'So you are interested in starting an exercise program because you've been a little bit more tired lately and you think it might be due to lack of exercise. And you've thought a little bit about starting a program. And I've asked you about your medical history, so I know that you do have high cholesterol.' This summary is accurate and helps to verify the information. Additionally, at the end of the interview, the student provides a comprehensive summary of the plan: 'So just to make sure that I explained that clearly, I know I was a little jumbled in what I was saying, could you tell me what we just agreed upon and what you got from that?' The patient then recaps the plan, confirming understanding. The student's consistent and accurate summarization throughout the interview meets the criteria for a score of 5."
QUESTIONING SKILLS DUPLICATION,Behavioral2,-,-
QUESTIONING SKILLS LACK OF JARGON,Behavioral2,,"The medical student consistently used language that was easily understood by the patient and avoided medical jargon throughout the interview. For example, instead of using the term 'hyperlipidemia,' the student referred to it as 'high cholesterol,' which is more commonly understood. When discussing medications, the student used the brand name 'Lipitor' rather than the generic name 'atorvastatin,' which is more familiar to most patients. The student also ensured that the patient understood the benefits of exercise in simple terms, such as 'Exercise is very good for your heart health, for your lung health, pretty much total body health.' Additionally, the student used phrases like 'back disc' instead of 'herniated disc,' which is more technical. The language used was appropriate to the patient's level of education and understanding, and the student made sure to clarify and confirm understanding, as seen when the student asked, 'So just to make sure that I explained that clearly, I know I was a little jumbled in what I was saying, could you tell me what we just agreed upon and what you got from that?' This approach ensured that the patient was fully informed and comfortable with the information provided."
QUESTIONING SKILLS VERIFICATION OF PATIENT INFORMATION,Behavioral2,,"The medical student frequently seeks clarification, verification, and specificity of the patient's responses, demonstrating a clear pattern of following up on important details. For example, when the patient mentioned taking Lipitor, the student asked, 'Do you know how long you've been on that?' and 'When was the last time you saw your doctor?' This shows an effort to gather specific information. Additionally, the student verified the patient's understanding of the plan by asking, 'So just to make sure that I explained that clearly, I know I was a little jumbled in what I was saying, could you tell me what we just agreed upon and what you got from that?' However, there were a few minor missed opportunities for further clarification, such as not probing deeper into the patient's tiredness over the past year or the specifics of her back pain. These missed opportunities are minor and do not significantly impact the overall understanding of the patient's situation, thus justifying a score of 4."
INTERACTIVE TECHNIQUES,Behavioral2,-,-
VERBAL FACILITATION SKILLS,Behavioral2,,"The medical student frequently used facilitation skills throughout the interview, but there were a few missed opportunities for more effective engagement. The student provided verbal encouragement and used short statements to keep the conversation flowing. For example, the student said, 'I'm glad you came in. We can certainly talk about that,' and 'My guess is that it will,' which are encouraging and supportive. The student also echoed the patient's concerns and statements, such as 'So you are interested in starting an exercise program because you've been a little bit more tired lately and you think it might be due to lack of exercise.' However, there were moments where the student could have used more specific verbal encouragement or asked more open-ended questions to delve deeper into the patient's feelings and motivations. Overall, the student demonstrated a good use of facilitation skills but could improve consistency and effectiveness to achieve a top score."

Additionally, when the patient expressed concerns about her varicose veins and reluctance to go to the gym, the student acknowledged it but did not delve deeper into how the patient felt about it. The student did not employ NURS techniques or equivalent methods to a significant extent. Overall, the student maintained a professional and neutral tone but missed opportunities for deeper empathy."
PATIENTS PERSPECTIVE & BELIEFS,Behavioral2,,"The medical student made some attempts to elicit the patient's perspective on her illness and exercise goals but did not fully explore all aspects of FIFE (Feelings, Ideas, Function, Expectations). The student asked about the patient's ideas on the cause of her tiredness ('Do you have any ideas as to what it might be?'), and the impact on her daily function ('Run me through a typical day for you'). However, the student did not delve deeply into the patient's feelings about her tiredness or her expectations for the exercise program. The conversation was more focused on gathering medical history and logistical details rather than understanding the patient's beliefs and emotional state. Therefore, the student demonstrated some awareness of the importance of the patient's viewpoint but did not comprehensively address it."
IMPACT OF ILLNESS ON PATIENT AND PATIENT_S SELF-IMAGE,Behavioral2,,"The medical student partially addresses the impact of the illness on the patient's life and self-image. The student acknowledges the patient's tiredness and its potential link to lack of exercise, and they discuss various exercise options. However, the student does not deeply explore the emotional or psychological impact of the patient's condition. The patient's concern about varicose veins and reluctance to wear a bathing suit is noted, but the student does not offer any counseling or resources to help with this self-image issue. The student does suggest involving family members in the exercise plan, which shows some awareness of the importance of support, but overall, the exploration of the patient's feelings and the impact of the illness on their life is limited. No specific counseling or resources are offered to address these concerns."

SUPPORT SYSTEMS,Behavioral2,,"The medical student thoroughly explored the patient's support systems across multiple dimensions. They inquired about emotional support by asking about the patient's family and who she lives with: 'Tell me something about your family. Who do you live with?' and 'How about family in the area? Do you have any other family members around?' They also discussed the patient's husband and his potential involvement in the exercise program: 'Do you think he would be at all interested in exercising with you?' and 'Do you think you'd like to exercise with someone, or do you see yourself exercising by yourself?' The student addressed financial support by asking about any financial concerns related to gym membership: 'Now, gyms can be somewhat of a financial burden. Do you have any financial concerns?' and confirmed that the patient has insurance: 'And do you have insurance?' Additionally, the student explored other resources by suggesting community resources like gyms and personal trainers: 'Now, gyms can be somewhat of a financial burden. Do you have any financial concerns?' and 'At the gym, another benefit is that they often have personal trainers.' The student also suggested involving the patient's daughter in the exercise program: 'Is there anyone else who lives nearby that you think would be willing to exercise with you?' and 'So how about we think about your starting a gym program and talking to your daughter, Lucy, and trying to get her involved in that with you.' Overall, the student demonstrated a comprehensive understanding of the patient's support systems and provided relevant suggestions."
PATIENTS EDUCATION AND UNDERSTANDING,Behavioral2,,"The medical student demonstrated a thorough and deliberate approach to ensuring the patient's understanding and addressing patient education.

The patient was able to accurately repeat the plan, indicating understanding: 'That I'm going to start at the gym that has the pool and go to that and see if my daughter and or my husband would like to do that and or go to the regular gym and have the personal trainer show me some of the bikes and things that they have and how to use them.' Additionally, the student provided detailed information about the benefits of exercise and tailored the discussion to the patient's interests and concerns, such as her varicose veins and back pain. The student also suggested involving family members to support the patient's exercise routine, demonstrating an understanding of the patient's social context.

I'm Natarcia.'), clarifies her role ('I'm a second-year medical student working with Dr. Smith today.'), inquires how to address the patient ('Is it okay if I call you Mr. Jones?'), and uses the patient's name ('Hi, Mr. Jones.'). Therefore, based on the criteria, the student deserves a score of 5."
ELICITS SPECTRUM OF CONCERNS,Behavioral3,,"The medical student successfully elicited the patient's full spectrum of concerns within the first 3-5 minutes of the interview. The student began by asking the patient what brought him in today and followed up with detailed questions about his eating habits and the changes since his daughter left for college. The student also asked, 'Do you have any other concerns for today?' and 'Let me know if you do, if you remember anything as we're talking,' ensuring that all concerns were addressed. This thorough approach aligns with the criteria for a score of 5."
NEGOTIATES PRIORITIES & SETS AGENDA,Behavioral3,,"The medical student did set an agenda by identifying the patient's primary concern about his eating habits and discussing potential solutions, such as seeing a dietician and enrolling in a cooking class. However, the student did not fully elicit all potential concerns at the beginning of the interview. The student asked, 'Do you have any other concerns for today?' but this was after a detailed discussion about the patient's eating habits. The patient mentioned irritability and sleep issues, which led to a discussion about his antidepressant use, but these were not initially elicited as part of setting the agenda. The student did not get the patient's agreement on the agenda at the onset of the interview. Therefore, the student accomplished a partial agenda but did not fully negotiate the patient's priorities comprehensively. Quotes to support this include: 'So you're here to talk about your eating habits and how to change them and make them better. Do you have any other concerns for today?' and 'Okay. Let me know if you do, if you remember anything as we're talking.'"

TIMELINE,Behavioral3,-,-
ORGANIZATION,Behavioral3,,"The medical student, Natarcia, conducted the interview in a mostly logical and organized manner, with only a few minor deviations. The interview began with an introduction and consent to call the patient by his last name, followed by an exploration of the patient's primary concern about his eating habits. The student then delved into the patient's current diet and past dietary habits, which was a logical progression. However, there were a few instances where the flow could have been smoother. For example, after discussing the patient's current diet, the student abruptly shifted to asking about the patient's daughter's college and then back to the diet (""Is she entering her first year?"" and ""Where is she going to school?""). This could have been streamlined to maintain focus on the dietary concerns. Additionally, the student asked about the patient's general health and medication history, which was relevant but could have been better integrated into the discussion about diet and lifestyle. The transition to discussing the patient's social support and living situation was well-handled, providing a comprehensive view of the patient's context. The student effectively used time to cover all necessary topics, including suggestions for dietary changes and resources for cooking classes. Overall, the interview was well-organized with minor areas for improvement in maintaining a seamless flow."
TRANSITIONAL STATEMENTS,Behavioral3,-,-
PACING OF INTERVIEW,Behavioral3,,-
QUESTIONING SKILLS TYPES OF QUESTIONS,Behavioral3,,"The medical student begins the interview with an open-ended question: 'What brings you in today?' This is a good start. However, the student quickly shifts to more specific and direct questions without consistently using open-ended questions to explore major lines of inquiry. For example, 'Why is that?' and 'Is she entering her first year?' are specific questions that follow the initial open-ended question. Additionally, the student uses a 'why' question early on: 'Why is that?' which can be perceived as judgmental. The student also asks multiple questions in a single turn: 'Do you have any other health concerns? Diabetes? No. High blood pressure? No. High cholesterol? Cancer?' This pattern continues throughout the interview, with the student often asking direct questions rather than open-ended ones. While the student does use some open-ended questions, such as 'So before I continue with talking about food and everything, why don't you tell me a little bit about yourself? How is your health?' these are not frequent enough to warrant a higher score. The presence of 'why' questions and multiple questions further justifies the score of 3."
QUESTIONING SKILLS SUMMARIZING,Behavioral3,,"The medical student made some attempts to summarize the data but did not do so consistently or completely. For example, after discussing the patient's current eating habits and health concerns, the student did not provide a comprehensive summary to ensure all information was accurate and complete. The student did summarize the patient's main concern about eating habits and the plan to see a dietician, but this was done towards the end of the interview and was somewhat incomplete. The student also missed opportunities to summarize after discussing the patient's medication, family history, and social history. For instance, after learning about the patient's antidepressant use and its effects, the student could have summarized this information to ensure clarity. Similarly, after discussing the patient's family history and social support, a summary would have been beneficial. Overall, while there were some attempts at summarization, they were not consistent or thorough enough to warrant a higher score."
QUESTIONING SKILLS DUPLICATION,Behavioral3,-,-
QUESTIONING SKILLS LACK OF JARGON,Behavioral3,,"The medical student consistently used language that was easily understood by the patient and avoided medical jargon throughout the interview. For example, when discussing the patient's diet, the student used simple terms like 'cereal,' 'beef jerky,' and 'whole milk' instead of more complex nutritional terminology. The student also ensured that any potentially unfamiliar terms were explained in a straightforward manner, such as when suggesting the patient see a 'registered dietician' and explaining what the dietician could help with. Additionally, the student used language appropriate to the patient's level of education and understanding, as seen in the discussion about cooking classes and making dietary changes. Overall, the student demonstrated excellent communication skills by keeping the conversation clear and accessible for the patient."
QUESTIONING SKILLS VERIFICATION OF PATIENT INFORMATION,Behavioral3,,"The medical student frequently seeks clarification, verification, and specificity of the patient's responses, demonstrating a clear pattern of following up on important details. For example, the student asks about the specific antidepressant and dosage ('Which antidepressant?' 'It's Zoloft.' 'And how many milligrams?' 'It's 10 milligrams a day.'), and verifies the patient's adherence to the medication ('And you're taking it every day?' 'Yes, I am.'). The student also clarifies the patient's current eating habits and past diet ('So what are you eating these days, then?' 'At this point, I've eaten everything that she left in the refrigerator... And now I'm eating cereal almost every meal.'). However, there are a few minor missed opportunities for further clarification, such as not probing deeper into the patient's irritability and sleep issues or the exact nature of the patient's financial stability. These missed opportunities are minor and do not significantly impact the overall understanding of the patient's situation, hence the score of 4."
INTERACTIVE TECHNIQUES,Behavioral3,-,-
VERBAL FACILITATION SKILLS,Behavioral3,,"The medical student, Natarcia, frequently uses facilitation skills throughout the interview, but there are a few missed opportunities and some instances where the application could be more effective. For example, Natarcia uses verbal encouragement and short statements such as 'Nice. Cool. That's great. Thank you. Good for her.' and 'Okay. Great. Absolutely.' These statements help to keep the conversation flowing and show engagement. Additionally, Natarcia echoes the patient's concerns and statements, such as 'So you're here to talk about your eating habits and how to change them and make them better.' and 'So you mentioned your dad. Where does he live?' This helps to validate the patient's experiences and keep the conversation on track. However, there are moments where the facilitation could be more timely or specific. For instance, when the patient mentions feeling irritable and having trouble sleeping, Natarcia could have provided more immediate verbal encouragement or empathy. Overall, Natarcia demonstrates a strong use of facilitation skills, but there is room for improvement in consistency and effectiveness."
NON-VERBAL FACILITATION SKILLS,Behavioral3,,-
EMPATHY AND ACKNOWLEDGING PATIENT CUES,Behavioral3,,"The medical student demonstrates a good level of empathy and acknowledges patient cues throughout the interview. The student uses supportive comments and shows understanding of the patient's situation, although there are some missed opportunities for deeper empathy. For example, when the patient mentions his daughter leaving for college and his struggle with preparing food, the student responds with 'Nice. Cool. That's great. Thank you. Good for her,' which acknowledges the situation but could have been more empathetic. The student does well in understanding the patient's perspective, such as when discussing the patient's eating habits and suggesting practical solutions like seeing a dietician and enrolling in a cooking class. The student also shows support by offering to help set up appointments and follow up. However, the student could have used more NURS techniques to name and respect the patient's emotions explicitly. Overall, the student makes clear attempts to connect emotionally with the patient and provides supportive comments, but there is room for improvement in executing deeper empathy."
PATIENTS PERSPECTIVE & BELIEFS,Behavioral3,,"The medical student makes a reasonable attempt to understand the patient's situation and concerns, particularly around his eating habits and the changes since his daughter left for college. The student asks about the patient's current diet, past diet, and some aspects of his health and social situation. However, the student does not fully explore the patient's feelings, ideas, impact on function, and expectations (FIFE) comprehensively. For example, the student does not ask about the patient's feelings regarding his new eating habits or how he thinks these changes might affect his health in the long term. The student also does not delve deeply into the patient's expectations for treatment or outcomes. While the student does suggest practical solutions like seeing a dietician and taking a cooking class, the exploration of the patient's personal beliefs and perspectives is somewhat superficial. Quotes to support this evaluation include: 'So you're here to talk about your eating habits and how to change them and make them better. Do you have any other concerns for today?' and 'So would you like to discuss making a change?' These questions show an attempt to address the patient's concerns but lack depth in exploring the patient's personal beliefs and feelings about his situation."
IMPACT OF ILLNESS ON PATIENT AND PATIENT_S SELF-IMAGE,Behavioral3,,"The medical student, Natarcia, thoroughly explores the impact of the patient's daughter's departure on his eating habits and overall lifestyle. She inquires about his feelings and how his life has changed, particularly focusing on his diet and social support network. For example, she asks, 'So you're here to talk about your eating habits and how to change them and make them better. Do you have any other concerns for today?' and 'So the Zoloft is making you feel better, but when you are feeling kind of down, do you feel like you have a social support network?' Natarcia also offers practical solutions and resources, such as suggesting a registered dietician and a community cooking class, which the patient finds motivating. She even discusses the potential social benefits of the cooking class, saying, 'And that would also be a really good way for you to meet people and to get more integrated into your community, since you said you're kind of lonely out in the rural Burlington area.' Overall, Natarcia's approach is comprehensive, empathetic, and resourceful, addressing both the practical and emotional aspects of the patient's situation."
IMPACT OF ILLNESS ON FAMILY,Behavioral3,-,-
SUPPORT SYSTEMS,Behavioral3,,"The medical student thoroughly explored the patient's support systems across multiple dimensions. The student inquired about the patient's emotional support by asking about his social interactions and relationships, such as his connection with his daughter, father, and colleagues: 'So the Zoloft is making you feel better, but when you are feeling kind of down, do you feel like you have a social support network?' The student also addressed the patient's financial support by confirming that he has insurance: 'You mentioned that you were financially stable. Did you say if you had insurance?' Additionally, the student suggested appropriate community resources, such as seeing a dietician and enrolling in a cooking class: 'Now, about teaching you how to cook, is there any kind of, do you know of any kind of community resources in your area where they can do classes or little tutorials on cooking?' The student even discussed the potential benefits of these resources for both improving the patient's nutrition and increasing his social interactions. Overall, the student demonstrated a comprehensive approach to understanding and enhancing the patient's support systems."
PATIENTS EDUCATION AND UNDERSTANDING,Behavioral3,,"The medical student, Natarcia, demonstrates a thorough and deliberate approach to ensuring Mr. Jones understands the information provided and is engaged in his own care. She uses several techniques to check his understanding and interest in patient education. For example, she asks if he would be willing to see a dietician and enroll in a cooking class, which he agrees to: 'So that's something you'd be willing to start up with?' and 'So is that something you'd be willing to enroll in?' She also offers practical advice and immediate steps he can take, such as switching to 1% or 2% milk: 'Like, have you thought about trying 1% or 2% milk just to bring down the fat content a bit?' Additionally, she ensures follow-up by suggesting a future appointment to review progress: 'And then we can also have you make an appointment to see me and Dr. Smith in two weeks to see how, if you had the first appointment, how that went.' Natarcia also provides motivational support by discussing the benefits of the proposed changes and how they align with Mr. Jones's goals: 'But you're looking into how to cook, so maybe that's just a default way to make friends.' Overall, her approach is comprehensive and patient-centered, ensuring Mr. Jones feels supported and understood."
ASSESS MOTIVATION FOR CHANGES,Behavioral3,,"The medical student did an excellent job of assessing the patient's motivation for change and offering a range of options and plans to support the change. The student inquired about the patient's feelings and readiness to make dietary changes multiple times throughout the conversation. For example, the student asked, 'So you're here to talk about how you can change that to make it a little bit more healthier for you,' and 'So would you like to discuss making a change?' The student also provided several actionable options, such as seeing a registered dietician, enrolling in a cooking class, and making immediate dietary adjustments like switching to 1% or 2% milk. Additionally, the student offered to follow up with the patient and even suggested signing a contract to solidify the patient's commitment to change. The patient's positive responses, such as 'I'd like to do that as soon as possible' and 'I'm feeling pretty motivated,' indicate that the student successfully engaged the patient in the process of change."
ADMITTING LACK OF KNOWLEDGE,Behavioral3,-,-
INFORMED CONSENT FOR INVESTIGATIONS & PROCEDURES,Behavioral3,-,-
ACHIEVE A SHARED PLAN,Behavioral3,,"The medical student, Natarcia, effectively discusses the patient's concerns about his eating habits and works collaboratively to develop a plan. She invites the patient to contribute his thoughts and preferences throughout the conversation. For example, she asks, 'So you're here to talk about how you can change that to make it a little bit more healthier for you,' and the patient confirms, 'That's exactly why I came.' Natarcia suggests seeing a dietician and asks for the patient's willingness: 'So that's something you'd be willing to start up with?' The patient responds positively, 'I'd like to do that as soon as possible.' Additionally, she explores the patient's interest in a local cooking class and its potential benefits, 'So is that something you'd be willing to enroll in?' and the patient agrees, 'Actually, I was thinking, and yes, that sounds like something I would do.' Natarcia also offers practical immediate changes, such as switching to 1% or 2% milk, and ensures follow-up by scheduling an appointment with the dietician and a follow-up visit with her and Dr. Smith. This comprehensive approach and active involvement of the patient in decision-making justify a score of 5."
ENCOURAGEMENT OF QUESTIONS,Behavioral3,,"The medical student consistently encourages the patient to ask questions and bring up additional topics throughout the interview. For example, early in the conversation, the student says, 'Do you have any other concerns for today?' and 'Let me know if you do, if you remember anything as we're talking.' These statements invite the patient to share more information or ask questions. Later, the student reiterates this openness by saying, 'But I really want you to feel like you can contact the office if you have any questions about nutrition or what you should be eating.' This shows a proactive approach to ensuring the patient feels comfortable bringing up any concerns. The student also checks in multiple times to ensure all the patient's concerns are addressed, such as asking, 'Do you have any other concerns for us today?' This consistent encouragement and openness to patient input justify a score of 5."
CLOSURE,Behavioral3,,"The medical student clearly specifies the future plans at the end of the interview. The student outlines what they will do: 'So I'm going to go talk to Dr. Smith and get you that paperwork, and you just stay right here, and I'll come back.' The student also specifies what the patient will do: 'we could make an appointment with a dietician that you can go talk to about that,' and 'we can also have you make an appointment to see me and Dr. Smith in two weeks to see how, if you had the first appointment, how that went.' Additionally, the student mentions the timing of the next steps: 'And that should start up in two weeks, you said?' and 'we can also have you make an appointment to see me and Dr. Smith in two weeks.' The student provides a comprehensive plan, including immediate actions, follow-up appointments, and additional resources, ensuring the patient knows what to expect next."
OPENING,Case1,,"The medical student introduces herself by saying, 'Hi, my name is Amy. It's nice to meet you.' and uses the patient's name, 'Hi, Mrs. Paulton?' However, she does not clarify her role or inquire how the patient prefers to be addressed. Therefore, the introduction is missing two key elements."
ELICITS SPECTRUM OF CONCERNS,Case1,,"The medical student, Amy, did a thorough job of eliciting details about the patient's chief complaint, which was the severe abdominal pain experienced the previous night. Amy asked several follow-up questions to understand the nature, location, duration, and associated symptoms of the pain. For example, she asked, 'Can you tell me more about the pain?' and 'Any other symptoms that you felt at the same time?' However, Amy did not ask a final 'Anything else?' question or an equivalent to ensure all concerns were raised. Additionally, while she did inquire about the patient's overall health, medications, allergies, family history, and social history, these questions were more about the patient's background rather than eliciting any additional concerns the patient might have had. Therefore, the score is a 3 because Amy elicited some of the patient's concerns but did not ensure she captured the full spectrum of concerns."
NEGOTIATES PRIORITIES & SETS AGENDA,Case1,,"The medical student did not negotiate the priorities or set an agenda for the visit. The student focused solely on the chief complaint and did not explore other potential concerns or priorities the patient might have had. The conversation was driven by the physician's questions about the patient's symptoms and medical history without any effort to establish a mutual agenda. For example, the physician started with 'So what brings you in today?' and then proceeded to ask detailed questions about the pain and symptoms without pausing to ask if there were other concerns or issues the patient wanted to address. The physician did not summarize or confirm the agenda with the patient at any point during the interview."
ELICITING THE NARRATIVE THREAD or the PATIENT_S STORY,Case1,,"The medical student, Amy, generally encourages the patient to talk about her problem and provides ample opportunity for the patient to share her story. For example, Amy asks open-ended questions like, 'Can you start from the beginning and really tell me everything you can remember about when it started?' and 'What did you do then? What happened next?' These questions allow the patient to provide a detailed narrative of her experience. However, there are instances where Amy interrupts or redirects the conversation, such as when she asks, 'So it woke you up out of sleep,' and 'Can you tell me more about the pain?' These interruptions are gentle and aimed at gathering more specific information, but they do slightly disrupt the patient's narrative flow. Overall, Amy mostly avoids introducing new information and focuses on understanding the patient's experience, which aligns with a score of 4."
TIMELINE,Case1,,"The medical student, Amy, successfully establishes a comprehensive timeline of the chief complaint and history of the present illness. She begins by asking the patient to recount the episode from the beginning, which allows the patient to describe the onset of pain at around 1 AM. Amy then systematically inquires about the nature of the pain, its location, and any movements or changes in the pain, such as it moving to the groin area. She also asks about the patient's actions to alleviate the pain, such as walking around and taking Tylenol, and notes that these did not help. Amy further explores the patient's symptoms, including the difficulty urinating and the eventual resolution of the pain around 5 AM, accompanied by a large amount of brown-colored urine. She also asks about associated symptoms like nausea and sweating, and whether these symptoms were constant or intermittent. By the end of the interview, Amy has gathered detailed information about the chronology and nature of the patient's symptoms, allowing for a clear understanding of the patient's experience. This thorough approach justifies a score of 5."
ORGANIZATION,Case1,,"The medical student, Amy, conducted the interview in a highly organized and logical manner. She began by establishing rapport and then systematically explored the patient's chief complaint, starting with the onset of the pain and its characteristics. For example, she asked, 'Can you start from the beginning and really tell me everything you can remember about when it started?' and followed up with specific questions about the pain's location, movement, and associated symptoms. Amy then transitioned smoothly to questions about the patient's overall health, medical history, and family history, ensuring that no relevant information was missed. She asked, 'How would you describe your overall health?' and 'Are there any diseases that run in your family?' Finally, she inquired about the patient's lifestyle and support systems, such as 'Do you drink alcohol?' and 'Can you tell me a little bit about your support systems?' The interview flowed seamlessly, and time was managed effectively, allowing all necessary information to be gathered within the allotted time."
TRANSITIONAL STATEMENTS,Case1,-,-
PACING OF INTERVIEW,Case1,,-
QUESTIONING SKILLS TYPES OF QUESTIONS,Case1,,"The medical student consistently begins lines of inquiry with open-ended questions and follows up with more specific questions to gather detailed information. For example, the student starts with 'So what brings you in today?' and 'Can you start from the beginning and really tell me everything you can remember about when it started?' These open-ended questions allow the patient to provide a comprehensive narrative. The student then uses more specific questions to clarify details, such as 'Can you tell me more about the pain?' and 'Was there anything different about the urine that came out?' The student avoids poor question types like leading, why, or multiple questions, ensuring that the patient can provide information without being led or confused. This approach is consistent throughout the interview, demonstrating excellent questioning skills."
QUESTIONING SKILLS SUMMARIZING,Case1,,"The medical student made some attempts to summarize the data but did not do so consistently or completely. For example, after discussing the initial episode of pain, the student did not summarize the key points before moving on to the next set of questions. The student did provide a brief summary towards the end of the interview: 'In terms of the history, I feel like we've gotten a pretty good idea of what's going on and the symptoms that you've had.' However, this summary was incomplete and lacked detail. The student missed several opportunities to summarize after major lines of inquiry, such as after discussing the pain characteristics, urinary symptoms, and overall health history. Therefore, the performance aligns with a score of 3."
QUESTIONING SKILLS DUPLICATION,Case1,,"The medical student, Amy, did not repeat questions unnecessarily throughout the interview. She asked for clarification and additional details when needed, but there was no evidence of her failing to remember previously provided information. For example, she asked, 'Can you tell me more about the pain?' after the patient initially described it, which is a reasonable request for more detail. Additionally, she summarized and confirmed information, such as 'So it woke you up out of sleep,' which helps ensure accuracy without disrupting the flow of the interview. Overall, Amy's questioning was thorough and well-organized, without unnecessary repetition."
QUESTIONING SKILLS LACK OF JARGON,Case1,,"The medical student consistently used language that was easily understood by the patient and avoided medical jargon throughout the interview. For example, instead of using medical terms like 'dysuria' or 'hematuria,' the student asked, 'Was there anything different about the urine that came out?' and 'was there any pain when you were able to pee?' The student also used simple terms like 'pee' instead of 'urinate,' which is more relatable to the patient. Additionally, the student ensured clarity by asking follow-up questions in a straightforward manner, such as 'Can you tell me more about the pain?' and 'How long did the pain last?' The language used was appropriate to the patient's level of education, and there were no instances where the patient seemed confused or needed clarification on medical terms. Overall, the student demonstrated excellent communication skills by maintaining a clear and jargon-free dialogue."
QUESTIONING SKILLS VERIFICATION OF PATIENT INFORMATION,Case1,,"The medical student frequently seeks clarification, verification, and specificity of the patient's responses, demonstrating a clear pattern of following up on important details. For example, the student asks for more details about the pain ('Can you tell me more about the pain? It was a tearing pain.'), its location ('And where was it?'), and its movement ('And did it move anywhere?'). The student also verifies the patient's actions and responses to the pain ('So you tried to walk around. That didn't seem to help.' and 'Anything you did to try to help it?'). Additionally, the student clarifies the patient's symptoms and their duration ('And while this was going on, while the pain was going on, was it constant? Did it come and go, or was it really constant for those hours?'). However, there are a few minor missed opportunities for further clarification, such as not probing deeper into the patient's description of the urine color change ('Was there anything different about the urine that came out?'). Overall, the student demonstrates a strong ability to seek clarification and verification, with only minor gaps that do not significantly impact the overall understanding of the patient's situation."
INTERACTIVE TECHNIQUES,Case1,-,-
VERBAL FACILITATION SKILLS,Case1,,"The medical student, Amy, frequently uses facilitation skills throughout the interview, but there are a few missed opportunities and some areas where the application could be more effective. Amy uses echoing and short statements to encourage the patient to continue sharing information, such as when she says, 'So it woke you up out of sleep,' and 'Can you tell me more about the pain?' These statements help to keep the conversation flowing and show that Amy is actively listening. Additionally, Amy provides verbal encouragement, such as 'Sounds like it was a long morning for you,' which acknowledges the patient's experience and encourages further sharing. However, there are moments where Amy could have provided more specific or timely verbal encouragement. For example, when the patient describes the pain as 'one of the worst pains I've had in my life,' Amy could have acknowledged the severity of the pain more empathetically. Overall, Amy demonstrates a strong use of facilitation skills, but there is room for improvement in consistency and effectiveness."
NON-VERBAL FACILITATION SKILLS,Case1,,-
EMPATHY AND ACKNOWLEDGING PATIENT CUES,Case1,,"The medical student, Amy, maintains a neutral tone throughout the interview. She asks relevant questions and gathers necessary information but does not demonstrate strong empathy or use NURS techniques. For example, when the patient describes the severe pain and the long night, Amy responds with 'Sounds like it was a long morning for you,' which acknowledges the situation but lacks emotional depth. There are no supportive comments or attempts to understand the patient's emotional experience deeply. The student does not make any negative or insensitive comments, but the overall approach is clinical and factual rather than empathetic. Therefore, a score of 3 is appropriate."
PATIENTS PERSPECTIVE & BELIEFS,Case1,-,-
IMPACT OF ILLNESS ON PATIENT AND PATIENT_S SELF-IMAGE,Case1,,"The medical student, Amy, makes limited attempts to address the impact of the illness on Mrs. Paulton's life or self-image. While Amy does inquire about the patient's support system and acknowledges the patient's experience ('Sounds like it was a long morning for you'), she does not delve deeply into how the illness has affected the patient's emotional state or daily life beyond the immediate episode. There is no exploration of the patient's feelings about the illness or its broader impact on her life. Additionally, no counseling or resources are offered to help the patient cope with the situation. The student shows some awareness of the importance of these issues but struggles to effectively address them or draw out the patient's feelings."
IMPACT OF ILLNESS ON FAMILY,Case1,-,-
SUPPORT SYSTEMS,Case1,,"The medical student made some effort to explore the patient's support systems but did not cover all aspects comprehensively. The student asked about the patient's main support system, which is her husband: 'Can you tell me a little bit about your support systems?' and confirmed that he was helpful and drove her to the appointment: 'I guess he's probably the main support system. I mean, he was helpful last night or was trying to be. Yeah. And he drove me in this morning.' However, the student did not inquire about financial support, healthcare access, or other community resources. Therefore, the student determined some of the available support but did not explore it thoroughly."

ENCOURAGEMENT OF QUESTIONS,Case1,,"The medical student did not provide the patient with any explicit opportunities to ask questions or discuss additional points throughout the interview. The student moved from one question to the next without pausing to invite the patient to ask questions or bring up additional topics. For example, after discussing the patient's pain and symptoms, the student immediately transitioned to questions about the patient's overall health without asking if the patient had any questions or additional information to share. Similarly, after discussing the patient's family history and daily life, the student did not encourage the patient to ask questions or discuss further concerns. The lack of encouragement for patient questions or additional topics is evident throughout the transcript."
CLOSURE,Case1,,"The medical student fails to specify the plans for the future at the end of the interview. The patient is left without a clear sense of what to expect next. The student concludes with, 'So at this point, I think we just need to do the physical exam, see if you need any tests, and then we'll move on from there,' but does not provide any specific details about what the patient should do, what the student will do, or when the next steps will occur. There is no mention of follow-up actions or timing, leaving the patient without closure."
OPENING,Case2,,"The medical student, Amy, successfully includes all key elements in the opening of the interview. She introduces herself ('My name is Amy'), clarifies her role ('I'm a medical student working with the doctors here today'), inquires how to address the patient ('Is Mrs. Paulton how you'd like to be addressed?'), and uses the patient's name ('Hi Mrs. Paulton'). Therefore, the introduction is complete and merits a score of 5."
ELICITS SPECTRUM OF CONCERNS,Case2,,"The medical student, Amy, effectively elicited the patient's full spectrum of concerns within the first 3-5 minutes of the interview. She started by asking why the patient was there and followed up with a question to ensure all concerns were addressed: 'Is there anything else that you want to make sure we address today before we talk more about that pain?' The patient mentioned a secondary concern about leaking urine, and Amy confirmed there were no other concerns by asking, 'Is there anything else you can think of that you want to make sure we don't miss today?' The patient responded with 'No,' indicating that all concerns had been raised. This thorough approach aligns with the criteria for a score of 5."
NEGOTIATES PRIORITIES & SETS AGENDA,Case2,,"The medical student, Amy, fully negotiates the priorities of the patient's concerns and sets the agenda at the onset of the interview. She begins by asking, 'Is there anything else that you want to make sure we address today before we talk more about that pain?' and follows up with, 'Is there anything else you can think of that you want to make sure we don't miss today?' This ensures that all of the patient's concerns are listed. Amy then sets the agenda by stating, 'Well, it sounds like the pain is a little bit more urgent right now. So, we'll start with the pain. We may get a little bit of a chance to talk about the incontinence as well... Does that sound okay?' The patient agrees to this agenda. Throughout the interview, Amy revisits the patient's concerns and ensures that they are addressed, demonstrating a thorough and patient-centered approach. This performance aligns with the criteria for a score of 5."
ELICITING THE NARRATIVE THREAD or the PATIENT_S STORY,Case2,,"The medical student begins to let the patient talk about their problem but frequently interrupts with focused questions and introduces new information into the conversation. For example, after the patient mentions the pain, the student immediately asks, 'Is there anything else that you want to make sure we address today before we talk more about that pain?' This pattern continues throughout the interview, with the student often redirecting the conversation to gather specific details ('How much Tylenol did you take?' 'Extra strength or regular?'). While the student does summarize the patient's story towards the end, the overall approach is more Q&A style rather than allowing the patient to narrate their experience uninterrupted."
TIMELINE,Case2,,"The medical student, Amy, successfully establishes a comprehensive timeline of the patient's chief complaint and history of the present illness. She begins by identifying the primary concern: 'I had an episode last night where I had really bad pain low in my belly.' Amy then systematically explores the characteristics of the pain, including its location ('right down here. My right side'), radiation ('it went down into my groin area'), severity ('maybe a ten'), and attempts at relief ('I tried some Tylenol... I took two tablets... regular strength'). She also inquires about associated symptoms such as urinary frequency ('I kept having, feeling like I had to pee'), the appearance of the urine ('kind of, I don't know, brownish color'), and nausea ('I was nauseous off and on'). Amy further confirms the absence of other symptoms like vomiting, diarrhea, and fever. She summarizes the information effectively: 'So you've had this pain that woke you up out of sleep this morning... Moves into your groin a little bit... you tried to walk around, took some Tylenol, nothing really helped... you also had this feeling that you had to pee... you finally were able to pass some urine, but you noticed it was kind of a funny reddish color... you had some nausea, but no vomiting.' This thorough approach ensures that a clear chronology of the chief complaint and associated symptoms is established, justifying a score of 5."
ORGANIZATION,Case2,,"The medical student demonstrated excellent organization throughout the interview. The conversation began with a clear introduction and confirmation of the patient's preferred form of address. The student then effectively prioritized the patient's concerns, focusing first on the more urgent issue of pain before addressing the secondary concern of incontinence. The student used logical sequencing in the questions, starting with the history of the present illness, followed by a review of systems, past medical history, family history, and social history. For example, the student asked about the location, nature, and severity of the pain before moving on to associated symptoms and potential alleviating or aggravating factors. The student also summarized the information gathered to ensure accuracy and completeness, as seen in the following exchange: 'Okay. So I just want to kind of summarize what you've told me so far since I jumped around a little bit and make sure that I got everything right. If anything's wrong, let me know for sure, or if we forgot anything.' This summary helped maintain clarity and organization. Time was managed effectively, with the student covering all necessary topics within the allotted time and ensuring that the patient felt heard and understood. The transitions between different sections of the interview were smooth, and the student maintained a logical flow throughout. Overall, the student's performance aligns with the criteria for a score of 5."

PACING OF INTERVIEW,Case2,,-
QUESTIONING SKILLS TYPES OF QUESTIONS,Case2,,"The medical student, Amy, begins the information gathering with an open-ended question: 'So, I just wanted to start by figuring out why you're here today.' This is followed by more specific questions to gather detailed information about the patient's symptoms. Amy mostly uses open-ended questions to start major lines of inquiry, such as 'Can you tell me a little bit more about the pain?' and 'Were there any other symptoms that you noticed at the same time as you had this pain?' However, there are instances where she starts with more specific questions, such as 'What kind of pain was it?' and 'How much Tylenol did you take?' The follow-up questions are mostly appropriate and help in gathering detailed information. There are very few poor question types used, with no leading, why, or multiple questions evident. Overall, Amy's questioning skills are strong, but the occasional use of specific questions to start a line of inquiry prevents a perfect score."
QUESTIONING SKILLS SUMMARIZING,Case2,,"The medical student demonstrated excellent summarization skills throughout the interview. They provided a comprehensive summary of the patient's history of present illness (HPI) towards the end of the interview, ensuring that all major points were covered and verified with the patient. For example, the student said, 'So I just want to kind of summarize what you've told me so far since I jumped around a little bit and make sure that I got everything right. If anything's wrong, let me know for sure, or if we forgot anything.' They then proceeded to accurately summarize the patient's symptoms, including the pain, its severity, location, associated urinary symptoms, and other relevant details. The student also checked for any missed information by asking, 'Does that sound like a reasonable summary? Anything I missed?' This approach ensured that the patient's history was complete and accurate. Additionally, the student provided another brief summary towards the end of the interview, stating, 'Okay, so I feel like we've gotten a pretty good sense today of the different symptoms that you've been having and I understand that you've been having this really terrible pain and so I think we need to really figure out what's going on with that.' This further reinforced the thoroughness of their summarization skills."
QUESTIONING SKILLS DUPLICATION,Case2,,"The medical student, Amy, generally avoids repeating questions unnecessarily and maintains a good flow throughout the interview. However, there are a few instances where she repeats questions or seeks information that has already been provided, albeit for clarification or summarization purposes. For example, after the patient describes the pain and its characteristics, Amy asks again, 'And you said the pain does radiate a little bit. It moves into your groin a little bit,' which the patient had already mentioned. Additionally, Amy asks about medications twice: 'Are there any other medicines that you take on a regular basis?' and later, 'How about medications? We already talked about the Tums that you're taking. You've taken some Tylenol. Do you take any other medicines?' These repetitions seem to be for clarification rather than due to a failure to remember the information. Therefore, a score of 4 is appropriate as the student only rarely repeats questions and does so primarily for clarification."
QUESTIONING SKILLS LACK OF JARGON,Case2,,"The medical student consistently used language that was easily understood by the patient and avoided medical jargon throughout the interview. For example, instead of using the term 'dysuria,' the student asked, 'Have you had any pain with urinating?' Similarly, the student used 'pee' instead of 'urinate,' which is more colloquial and likely more familiar to the patient. When discussing the patient's use of Tums, the student explained, 'That may be too many. We'll have to talk a little bit more about that later. Certainly, they're not doing anything terrible to you, but we should probably talk about some other ways to get some calcium into your system,' which is clear and avoids unnecessary medical terminology. The student also used a pain scale ('If you had to qualify it or quantify it on a scale where zero is no pain and ten is the worst thing ever, where would you put it?') that is straightforward and commonly understood. Overall, the language used was appropriate to the patient's level of education and free of difficult medical terms, justifying a score of 5."
QUESTIONING SKILLS VERIFICATION OF PATIENT INFORMATION,Case2,,"The medical student consistently sought clarification, verification, and specificity throughout the interview. For example, when the patient mentioned taking Tylenol, the student asked, 'How much Tylenol did you take?' and followed up with 'Extra strength or regular?' to ensure accurate information. The student also clarified the patient's fluid intake by asking, 'What do you normally drink during the day?' and verified the patient's medication use by asking, 'Do you take any other medicines?' Additionally, the student summarized the patient's symptoms and asked for confirmation, 'Does that sound like a reasonable summary? Anything I missed?' This thorough approach demonstrates a consistent effort to understand the patient's situation fully, justifying a score of 5."
INTERACTIVE TECHNIQUES,Case2,-,-
VERBAL FACILITATION SKILLS,Case2,,"The medical student, Amy, frequently uses facilitation skills throughout the interview, but there are a few missed opportunities and some areas where the application could be more effective. Amy uses verbal encouragement and short statements to keep the patient talking, such as 'Okay,' 'All right,' and 'That must have been scary.' She also echoes the patient's statements to show understanding, like when she says, 'Okay. So you've had this pain that woke you up out of sleep this morning. It was really severe, tearing pain in your right side, about a 10 out of 10, really one of the worst pains you've ever had.' However, there are moments where more specific verbal encouragement could have been used to delve deeper into the patient's concerns, such as when the patient mentions feeling nauseous or having brownish urine. Overall, Amy demonstrates a strong use of facilitation skills but falls short of the consistency and effectiveness required for a perfect score."
NON-VERBAL FACILITATION SKILLS,Case2,,-
EMPATHY AND ACKNOWLEDGING PATIENT CUES,Case2,,"The medical student, Amy, demonstrates a good level of empathy throughout the interview, though there are some missed opportunities for deeper connection. She uses supportive comments and acknowledges the patient's emotions, such as when she says, 'That must have been scary,' and 'It sounds like it was pretty scary.' These comments show an understanding of the patient's emotional state. Amy also uses techniques to ensure the patient feels heard and understood, like summarizing the patient's concerns and asking for confirmation: 'Okay. So you've had this pain that woke you up out of sleep this morning... Does that sound like a reasonable summary? Anything I missed?' This shows an effort to respect and support the patient's experience. However, there are moments where Amy could have delved deeper into the patient's emotional state or provided more reassurance, such as when the patient mentions the pain being 'really bad' and 'very frightening.' Overall, Amy's performance is strong, but with room for improvement in consistently employing deeper empathetic techniques."
PATIENTS PERSPECTIVE & BELIEFS,Case2,-,-
IMPACT OF ILLNESS ON PATIENT AND PATIENT_S SELF-IMAGE,Case2,,"The medical student, Amy, conducted a thorough history-taking and addressed the patient's immediate medical concerns, such as the severe abdominal pain and urinary issues. However, she did not explore the impact of the illness on the patient's life or self-image. There were no inquiries about how the pain or urinary incontinence affected the patient's daily activities, emotional well-being, or self-perception. Additionally, no counseling or resources were offered to help the patient cope with these issues. The focus remained strictly on the medical symptoms and potential diagnoses, without delving into the broader impact on the patient's life. For example, Amy did not ask questions like 'How has this pain affected your daily life?' or 'How are you feeling emotionally about these symptoms?'"
IMPACT OF ILLNESS ON FAMILY,Case2,-,-
SUPPORT SYSTEMS,Case2,,"The medical student did not explore the patient's support systems at all during the interview. The conversation focused solely on the patient's symptoms, medical history, and lifestyle habits. There were no questions or discussions about the patient's emotional support, financial support, or other resources available to the patient and family. For example, the student did not ask about the patient's family dynamics, social support, or any community resources that might be available to her. Therefore, based on the provided rubric, the student fails to determine what support is currently available to the patient."

ENCOURAGEMENT OF QUESTIONS,Case2,,"The medical student consistently encouraged the patient to ask questions and bring up additional topics throughout the interview. Early in the conversation, the student asked, 'Is there anything else that you want to make sure we address today before we talk more about that pain?' and 'Is there anything else you can think of that you want to make sure we don't miss today?' These questions provided the patient with multiple opportunities to bring up additional concerns. The student also summarized the patient's information and asked, 'Does that sound like a reasonable summary? Anything I missed?' which further encouraged the patient to add any missed details. Finally, before concluding, the student asked, 'Is there anything that you wanted to ask me? Any questions that you have?' This consistent pattern of encouraging patient input and questions demonstrates a high level of engagement and openness, justifying a score of 5."
CLOSURE,Case2,,"The medical student makes limited attempts to specify future plans at the end of the interview. The student mentions that they will do a physical exam and then discuss the findings and plan together: 'I think at this point it would be good for us to do physical exam, get some more information, and then after that we can talk and I'll tell you what I'm thinking about what it might be and we can talk together about what our plan will be to go from here.' However, the information provided is somewhat vague and incomplete. The student does not specify what the patient should do next or when the next communication or appointment will be. The patient is left with an unclear sense of what to expect beyond the immediate physical exam."
OPENING,Case3,,"The medical student, Brianna, successfully includes all key elements in the opening of the interview. She introduces herself ('Hi, I'm Brianna'), clarifies her role ('I'm a medical student'), inquires how to address the patient ('Is that how you'd like to be addressed today?'), and uses the patient's name ('Nice to meet you, Dan'). Therefore, based on the criteria, the student deserves a score of 5."
ELICITS SPECTRUM OF CONCERNS,Case3,,"The medical student, Brianna, did a thorough job of eliciting the patient's chief complaint and secondary concerns within the first 3-5 minutes of the interview. She asked about the nature of the chest pain, what exacerbates and alleviates it, and the patient's concerns about it being heart-related. She also inquired about the patient's work and how the pain might affect it. However, Brianna did not ask a final 'Anything else?' question or an equivalent to ensure all concerns were raised. For example, she could have asked, 'Is there anything else you are worried about?' to make sure no concerns were missed. Therefore, the score is a 4."
NEGOTIATES PRIORITIES & SETS AGENDA,Case3,,"The medical student did not negotiate the priorities or set an agenda for the visit. The student focused primarily on the chief complaint of chest pain and did not explore other potential concerns or priorities the patient might have had. The student did not explicitly list all of the patient's concerns or set an agenda at the onset of the interview. For example, the student began with, 'So I'd like to just talk with you for a little bit before the doctor comes in about what brings you in. Is that okay?' but did not follow up with a comprehensive agenda-setting or prioritization of issues. The conversation was driven by the physician's questions rather than a negotiated agenda with the patient."
ELICITING THE NARRATIVE THREAD or the PATIENT_S STORY,Case3,,"The medical student primarily conducted the interview in a Q&A style, which limited the patient's ability to freely narrate their story. While the student did ask open-ended questions initially, such as 'tell me a little bit about what brought you to the office today,' the conversation quickly shifted to a series of focused questions. For example, the student asked, 'What makes it sharp?' and 'Is there anything that makes the pain better?' These questions, while relevant, interrupted the patient's narrative flow. Additionally, the student frequently introduced new information and redirected the conversation, as seen when they asked about the dosage of Advil and the patient's past medical history. This approach did not allow the patient to fully elaborate on their concerns without interruption. Therefore, the student's performance aligns more closely with a score of 2."
TIMELINE,Case3,,"The medical student, Brianna, successfully establishes a comprehensive timeline of the patient's chief complaint and history of the present illness. She identifies that the chest pain started two nights ago and is associated with a mountain biking incident where the patient fell and hit his chest. The student also clarifies that the pain is sometimes aching and sometimes sharp, worsened by lifting and alleviated by Advil and rest. She confirms that the pain has not changed in intensity over the past two days. Additionally, Brianna ensures there are no other associated symptoms like coughing or shortness of breath. The chronology of the symptoms and the context of the incident are well-documented, allowing for a clear understanding of the patient's condition. Direct quotes supporting this include: 'It started about two nights ago,' 'It's made worse if you're lifting things,' 'It's made better by Advil,' and 'I fell off towards the end, hit a bump that I didn't quite see, hit myself on the bike as I fell.'"
ORGANIZATION,Case3,,"The medical student, Brianna, conducted the interview in a highly organized and logical manner. She began with introductions and consent, then moved systematically through the patient's presenting complaint, history of present illness, past medical history, family history, social history, and finally, a summary and plan. Each section flowed naturally into the next, and she used summarization effectively to ensure understanding and accuracy. For example, after discussing the patient's chest pain, she summarized: 'So it sounds like you've had chest pain for two days now... Does that sound about right?' This approach ensured that the patient and physician were on the same page. Additionally, Brianna managed time effectively, covering all necessary aspects without rushing or prolonging any section unnecessarily. The interview was comprehensive and well-structured, demonstrating excellent organizational skills."

PACING OF INTERVIEW,Case3,,-
QUESTIONING SKILLS TYPES OF QUESTIONS,Case3,,"The medical student, Brianna, begins the information gathering with an open-ended question: 'All right, so tell me a little bit about what brought you to the office today.' This is a strong start and sets the tone for the interview. Throughout the interview, Brianna mostly uses open-ended questions to gather information, such as 'Can you tell me a little bit about that?' and 'Do you lift on a regular basis or did you notice it somehow?' However, there are instances where she uses more specific or direct questions to begin new lines of inquiry, such as 'Do you have any other symptoms besides the pain in your chest?' and 'Have you ever had surgery before?' These are appropriate follow-up questions but could have been initiated with more open-ended questions. There are very few poor question types used, with no leading, why, or multiple questions evident. Overall, Brianna's questioning skills are strong, but there is room for improvement in consistently starting new lines of inquiry with open-ended questions."
QUESTIONING SKILLS SUMMARIZING,Case3,,"The medical student consistently summarizes the data obtained at the end of each major line of inquiry, ensuring that the information is verified and clarified with the patient. For example, after discussing the patient's chest pain, the student summarizes: 'So it sounds like you've had chest pain for two days now. Sometimes it's an ache, sometimes it's sharp. It's made worse if you're lifting things and you're worried because at work you lift boxes. It's made better by Advil. You said you've taken like two in the morning, two in the afternoon. That seems to help. You're not sure what the dose is on that. And it doesn't radiate anywhere. You have no other symptoms with that. Does that sound about right?' The patient confirms this summary. Similarly, after discussing the patient's past medical history, the student summarizes: 'So just to summarize your past medical history, it sounds like you're pretty healthy. You just have seasonal allergies in the fall. And you said you take Flonase for that? ... And you haven't been hospitalized or anything like that. And your mom has diabetes for which she uses insulin. ... And she's had surgery on her heart valves in the past.' The student also summarizes the social history and the events surrounding the chest pain: 'So it sounds like you, we already talked about your job and you lift boxes at work and your free time you like to mountain bike and you do drink about a six pack of beer on the weekends and you have been drinking and mountain biking at the same time. And this past weekend you were mountain biking when your chest pain started because you fell off your mountain bike.' These summaries are accurate and comprehensive, demonstrating the student's effective summarization skills."
QUESTIONING SKILLS DUPLICATION,Case3,,"The medical student, Brianna, generally avoids repeating questions unnecessarily and maintains a good flow throughout the interview. However, there are a few instances where she repeats questions or information that the patient has already provided. For example, after the patient mentions that lifting makes the pain worse, Brianna asks again, 'Okay, and you said lifting makes it worse.' Additionally, she repeats the information about the patient's work and lifting boxes multiple times: 'Okay, and you lift boxes at work?' and 'So it sounds like you, we already talked about your job and you lift boxes at work.' These repetitions are not for clarification or summarization but seem to stem from a need to confirm information. Despite these minor repetitions, the overall flow of the interview is not significantly disrupted, and Brianna effectively summarizes the patient's information at various points. Therefore, a score of 4 is appropriate."
QUESTIONING SKILLS LACK OF JARGON,Case3,,"The medical student consistently used language that was easily understood by the patient and avoided medical jargon throughout the interview. For example, instead of using terms like 'myocardial infarction' or 'angina,' the student referred to the patient's concern as 'heart pain.' When discussing medications, the student used the brand name 'Advil' rather than the generic name 'ibuprofen,' which is more commonly recognized by patients. Additionally, the student asked about 'lifting boxes' and 'mountain biking' in straightforward terms, ensuring the patient could easily follow the conversation. The student also summarized the patient's history and symptoms in simple language, confirming understanding with the patient. Overall, the language used was appropriate to the patient's level of education, and there were no instances of unexplained medical jargon."
QUESTIONING SKILLS VERIFICATION OF PATIENT INFORMATION,Case3,,"The medical student frequently seeks clarification, verification, and specificity of the patient's responses, demonstrating a clear pattern of following up on important details. For example, the student asks about the nature of the pain ('Can you tell me a little bit about that?'), what makes it worse ('What makes it sharp?'), and what makes it better ('Is there anything that makes the pain better?'). The student also verifies the dosage of Advil ('Do you know what the dose is of the Advil?') and the patient's medical history ('Do you take any medicines on a daily basis?'). Additionally, the student clarifies the patient's social history and activities ('Have you been mountain biking recently?'). However, there are a few minor missed opportunities for further clarification, such as not asking more about the specific location of the chest pain or the exact nature of the fall during mountain biking. These minor gaps do not significantly impact the overall understanding of the patient's situation, but they prevent the score from being a perfect 5."
INTERACTIVE TECHNIQUES,Case3,-,-
VERBAL FACILITATION SKILLS,Case3,,"The medical student frequently uses facilitation skills during the interview, but not as consistently or effectively as in a score of 5. The student provides verbal encouragement and uses short statements to keep the conversation going. For example, the student says, 'Oh, I'm really sorry to hear about that. Can you tell me a little bit about that?' and 'Okay, and is there anything that makes the pain better?' These statements help to encourage the patient to provide more information. The student also uses echoing effectively, such as when summarizing the patient's symptoms: 'So it sounds like you've had chest pain for two days now. Sometimes it's an ache, sometimes it's sharp.' However, there are a few missed opportunities for more specific verbal encouragement or deeper exploration of the patient's feelings and concerns. For instance, when the patient expresses worry about returning to work, the student could have provided more empathetic responses or reassurance. Overall, the student demonstrates good facilitation skills but could improve in consistency and depth."
NON-VERBAL FACILITATION SKILLS,Case3,,-
EMPATHY AND ACKNOWLEDGING PATIENT CUES,Case3,,"The medical student, Brianna, demonstrates a neutral level of empathy throughout the interview. She acknowledges the patient's concerns and provides a thorough history-taking, but there are limited explicit expressions of empathy or emotional support. For example, when the patient mentions being worried about his heart, Brianna responds with 'Oh, I'm really sorry to hear about that,' which is a basic acknowledgment but lacks depth. She does not employ NURS techniques or delve deeper into the patient's emotional state. Additionally, when the patient expresses worry about returning to work, Brianna responds with 'Okay, well, that's understandable,' which is a neutral acknowledgment but does not offer much emotional support. Overall, Brianna's approach is professional and thorough but lacks the deeper empathetic connection that would warrant a higher score."
PATIENTS PERSPECTIVE & BELIEFS,Case3,-,-
IMPACT OF ILLNESS ON PATIENT AND PATIENT_S SELF-IMAGE,Case3,,"The medical student, Brianna, makes limited attempts to address the impact of the illness on Dan's life or self-image. While she does inquire about his work and living situation, she does not delve deeply into how the chest pain is affecting his emotional state or self-perception. For example, Dan mentions his concern about returning to work and the potential impact on his job, but Brianna does not explore his feelings about this worry or offer any counseling or resources to help him manage this concern. The conversation is more focused on gathering medical history and symptoms rather than exploring the broader impact of the illness on Dan's life. Quotes such as 'I'm worried if that's gonna interfere with that or if it's my heart, it might make it worse' and 'I'm just worried about when I go back to work' indicate Dan's concerns, but Brianna does not address these worries in depth."
IMPACT OF ILLNESS ON FAMILY,Case3,-,-
SUPPORT SYSTEMS,Case3,,"The medical student, Brianna, does a commendable job in exploring the patient's support systems, though not comprehensively enough to warrant a perfect score. She addresses the emotional support by asking about the patient's living situation and relationships: 'And do you have any family or friends in the area?' and 'My girlfriend lives in town.' She further explores the patient's reliance on his girlfriend: 'So do you think that you could look to your girlfriend in a time of need for her to help you out if you were sick or anything like that?' This shows an understanding of the patient's emotional support system. However, the student does not delve into the patient's financial support or healthcare access, which are crucial aspects of a comprehensive evaluation. The student does touch on the patient's work situation and potential need for a doctor's note: 'Do you think your boss would be okay with you taking some time off if you needed to?' but does not explore other financial or community resources. Therefore, the student covers two of the three main areas (emotional and some aspects of other resources) but misses out on financial support, leading to a score of 4."

ENCOURAGEMENT OF QUESTIONS,Case3,,"The medical student did not provide the patient with any explicit opportunities to ask questions or discuss additional points throughout the interview. The student moved from one question to the next without pausing to check if the patient had any questions or additional concerns. For example, after summarizing the patient's symptoms and history, the student immediately transitioned to the next topic without asking if the patient had any questions or additional information to provide: 'So just to summarize your past medical history, it sounds like you're pretty healthy... And your mom has diabetes for which she uses insulin.' There was no point in the conversation where the student explicitly encouraged the patient to ask questions or bring up additional topics, which is why the score is a 1."
CLOSURE,Case3,,"The medical student makes limited attempts to specify future plans at the end of the interview. The student mentions, 'I will talk with my doctor and you can wait here. I'll be back in a few minutes,' which indicates some awareness of the need for closure. However, the information provided is vague and incomplete, leaving the patient with an unclear sense of what to expect next. The student does not specify what actions the patient should take, nor does she provide a clear timeline for the next steps beyond 'a few minutes.' There is no mention of any follow-up appointments or further instructions for the patient."
OPENING,Case4,,"The physician introduces herself by saying, 'Hi, I'm Brianna,' and uses the patient's name, 'Hi, I'm Dan.' However, the physician does not clarify her role or inquire how the patient prefers to be addressed. Therefore, the introduction is missing two key elements, resulting in a score of 3."
ELICITS SPECTRUM OF CONCERNS,Case4,,"The medical student, Brianna, successfully elicited the patient's full spectrum of concerns within the first 3-5 minutes of the interview. She asked the patient, Dan, what brought him in today and followed up with 'Is there anything else that brought you in today?' to ensure all concerns were raised. Dan mentioned his chest pain, concern about his heart, and how it might impact his job. Brianna then confirmed these concerns by summarizing them and asking, 'Is there anything else you'd like to talk about today before we move on?' to which Dan responded, 'No, that's it.' This thorough approach ensured that all of Dan's concerns were addressed early in the interview."
NEGOTIATES PRIORITIES & SETS AGENDA,Case4,,"The medical student, Brianna, fully negotiates the priorities of the patient's concerns and sets the agenda at the onset of the interview. She begins by asking, 'What brings you in today?' and follows up with, 'Is there anything else that brought you in today?' This allows the patient to express all his concerns, which include chest pain, heart health, and its impact on his job. Brianna then confirms the patient's concerns by summarizing them: 'Okay. So you're concerned about your chest pain. You're concerned about your heart. You're also concerned about your job. Okay. Is there anything else you'd like to talk about today before we move on?' This ensures that all concerns are listed. She sets the agenda by stating, 'So I'll just ask a little bit about your chest pain, and then we'll get some information that will help me assess your risk of heart disease since it sounds like you're concerned about that, and then we'll find out a little bit about your job. Okay. Is that okay?' The patient agrees, indicating that the agenda is mutually agreed upon. Throughout the interview, Brianna revisits the patient's concerns and ensures they are addressed, demonstrating a thorough and patient-centered approach."
ELICITING THE NARRATIVE THREAD or the PATIENT_S STORY,Case4,,"The medical student begins to let the patient talk about their problem but frequently interrupts with focused questions and introduces new information into the conversation. For example, after the patient mentions their concern about chest pain and its impact on their job, the student immediately redirects to asking about the specifics of the chest pain: 'So I'll just ask a little bit about your chest pain, and then we'll get some information that will help me assess your risk of heart disease since it sounds like you're concerned about that, and then we'll find out a little bit about your job. Okay. Is that okay?' This pattern continues throughout the interview, with the student often steering the conversation with specific questions rather than allowing the patient to narrate their story more freely. While the student does gather comprehensive information, the approach is more Q&A style rather than a conversational flow, which aligns with a score of 3."
TIMELINE,Case4,,"The medical student, Brianna, successfully establishes a comprehensive timeline of the patient's chief complaint and history of the present illness. She begins by identifying the onset of the chest pain ('About two nights ago'), and then explores the circumstances surrounding the onset ('I was mountain biking, and I ended up falling off and hit myself'). She further clarifies the progression of the pain ('Yesterday it was more severe, the pain. And it hasn't gone away yet'). Brianna also inquires about the nature of the pain ('It's like an aching pain that's always there'), its triggers ('there's a sharpness that will come sometimes when I move'), and alleviating factors ('I've been taking some Advil, and that's helped, and just staying still'). Additionally, she explores associated symptoms and the patient's concerns about his heart health and work. The chronology of all associated symptoms and relevant details are well established, justifying a score of 5."
ORGANIZATION,Case4,,"The medical student, Brianna, conducted the interview in a highly organized and logical manner. She began by establishing rapport and understanding the patient's primary concerns. She then systematically addressed each concern, starting with the chest pain, followed by the patient's medical history, family history, and social history. For example, she clearly outlined the plan: 'I'll just ask a little bit about your chest pain, and then we'll get some information that will help me assess your risk of heart disease since it sounds like you're concerned about that, and then we'll find out a little bit about your job.' This approach ensured that all relevant information was gathered in a structured way. Additionally, she effectively summarized the patient's concerns and provided reassurance and a plan for further evaluation: 'So it sounds like your three main concerns today were your chest pain, your heart health, and your work.' Time was used efficiently, and the interview flowed seamlessly without any noticeable jumps between topics. Overall, Brianna's performance aligns well with the criteria for a score of 5."
TRANSITIONAL STATEMENTS,Case4,-,-
PACING OF INTERVIEW,Case4,,-
QUESTIONING SKILLS TYPES OF QUESTIONS,Case4,,"The medical student, Brianna, begins the information gathering with an open-ended question: 'What brings you in today?' This is a strong start and sets the tone for the interview. Throughout the conversation, Brianna mostly uses open-ended questions to explore the patient's concerns, such as 'Why don't you tell me about when your chest pain started?' and 'Can you tell me about what the pain feels like to you?' These questions allow the patient to provide detailed information. However, there are instances where Brianna uses more specific or direct questions to gather information, such as 'Were you wearing a helmet?' and 'Do you usually mountain bike at night?' While these questions are appropriate and necessary, they do not follow the open-ended format. Additionally, Brianna occasionally uses leading questions, such as 'And do you ever feel like maybe you're drinking too much or do you feel like you're drinking just as much as other people are drinking?' This could potentially influence the patient's response. Despite these minor issues, Brianna's questioning skills are strong overall, with a good balance of open-ended and specific questions, and very few poor question types."
QUESTIONING SKILLS SUMMARIZING,Case4,,"The medical student consistently summarizes the data obtained at the end of each major line of inquiry. For example, after discussing the patient's initial concerns, the student summarizes: 'Okay. So you're concerned about your chest pain. You're concerned about your heart. You're also concerned about your job.' This pattern continues throughout the interview. After discussing the chest pain, the student summarizes: 'So it started two nights ago when you were mountain biking and you hit your chest on the handles. And tell me how it's been since that point.' The student also provides a comprehensive summary towards the end of the interview: 'So it sounds like your three main concerns today were your chest pain, that started a couple days ago, your heart health, because you're worried that you might be at risk for heart disease because of your mom, and then also your work.' These summaries help verify and clarify the information, ensuring a complete history is obtained."
QUESTIONING SKILLS DUPLICATION,Case4,,"The medical student, Brianna, demonstrated excellent questioning skills without unnecessary repetition. She effectively summarized and clarified information without duplicating questions. For instance, she confirmed the patient's concerns about chest pain, heart health, and job impact early in the interview and did not revisit these points unnecessarily. When discussing the chest pain, she asked about the onset, nature, and exacerbating factors without repeating questions. Additionally, she efficiently gathered the patient's medical and social history without redundancy. The only instance that might seem repetitive is when she asked the patient to remind her of his age, but this was contextually appropriate to address the patient's concern about his mother's heart surgery. Overall, Brianna maintained a smooth interview flow and avoided disrupting it with repeated questions."
QUESTIONING SKILLS LACK OF JARGON,Case4,,"The medical student, Brianna, generally uses language that is easily understood by the patient, Dan. She avoids complex medical jargon for the most part and explains terms when necessary. For example, she uses simple language when discussing the patient's activities and symptoms: 'What were you doing at the time when your chest pain started?' and 'Can you tell me about what the pain feels like to you?' However, there are instances where she uses medical terms without immediate explanation, such as 'atherosclerosis' and 'angina,' which the patient does not understand. She does follow up with simpler questions, but there is a slight delay in defining these terms. Overall, the language used is mostly appropriate to the patient's level of education, with minor lapses."
QUESTIONING SKILLS VERIFICATION OF PATIENT INFORMATION,Case4,,"The medical student frequently seeks clarification, verification, and specificity of the patient's responses, demonstrating a clear pattern of following up on important details. For example, the student asks about the circumstances of the chest pain onset ('What were you doing at the time when your chest pain started?'), verifies the patient's alcohol consumption ('How much had you had to drink before you rode your mountain bike?'), and explores the patient's family history of heart disease ('Do you know if she had atherosclerosis?'). However, there are a few minor missed opportunities for further clarification, such as not probing deeper into the patient's description of the pain ('It's like an aching pain that's always there') or the patient's statement about their mother's heart surgery ('Do you know what kind of heart surgery she had?'). These missed opportunities are minor and do not significantly impact the overall understanding of the patient's situation, thus warranting a score of 4."
INTERACTIVE TECHNIQUES,Case4,-,-
VERBAL FACILITATION SKILLS,Case4,,"The medical student frequently uses facilitation skills during the interview, but not as consistently or effectively as in a score of 5. The student uses verbal encouragement and short statements to keep the patient talking, such as 'Okay,' 'I see,' and 'That's good to hear.' The student also echoes the patient's concerns, like 'So you're concerned about your chest pain. You're concerned about your heart. You're also concerned about your job.' However, there are a few missed opportunities for more specific verbal encouragement or deeper exploration of the patient's feelings and concerns. For example, when the patient expresses nervousness about the chest pain and its impact on his job, the student could have provided more reassurance or explored the patient's emotional state further. Overall, the student demonstrates good facilitation skills but could improve by being more consistent and specific in their verbal encouragement."
NON-VERBAL FACILITATION SKILLS,Case4,,-
EMPATHY AND ACKNOWLEDGING PATIENT CUES,Case4,,"The medical student, Brianna, demonstrates a neutral level of empathy throughout the interview. She acknowledges the patient's concerns and provides appropriate responses, but there are missed opportunities for deeper empathetic engagement. For example, when the patient expresses concern about the chest pain and its impact on his job, Brianna acknowledges these concerns but does not delve deeper into the patient's emotional state or provide much reassurance beyond the factual information. She says, 'Okay. So you're concerned about your chest pain. You're concerned about your heart. You're also concerned about your job. Okay. Is there anything else you'd like to talk about today before we move on?' This shows she is listening but does not fully engage with the patient's emotional experience. Additionally, when the patient mentions being nervous about the pain and its potential impact on his heart, Brianna responds with factual information but does not offer much emotional support: 'Okay. Well, I'm glad you came in.' Overall, Brianna's approach is professional and thorough, but it lacks the depth of empathetic engagement that would warrant a higher score."
PATIENTS PERSPECTIVE & BELIEFS,Case4,-,-
IMPACT OF ILLNESS ON PATIENT AND PATIENT_S SELF-IMAGE,Case4,,"The medical student partially addresses the impact of the illness on the patient's life and self-image. The student acknowledges the patient's concern about how the chest pain might affect his job and offers to provide a work excuse (""Once we finish up the visit and we do the exam and get a better idea of what's causing your pain, I would be more than happy to speak with my preceptor and see if we can get a work excuse for you so you can have some recovery time.""). However, the student does not deeply explore the patient's feelings about the illness or its broader impact on his life and self-image. There is no discussion about the emotional or psychological impact of the chest pain or the patient's concerns about his heart health beyond the immediate physical symptoms and job implications. Additionally, while the student provides some advice on lifestyle changes (""I might recommend that you try and drink fewer beers in one sitting"" and ""smoking is another thing that if you feel like your heart health is a priority, that's something that you could change in your life""), there is no comprehensive counseling or resources offered to help the patient manage these changes."
IMPACT OF ILLNESS ON FAMILY,Case4,-,-
SUPPORT SYSTEMS,Case4,,"The medical student did not explore the patient's support systems effectively. There was no discussion about the patient's emotional support, financial support, or other resources available to the patient and family. The conversation focused primarily on the patient's medical history, the details of the chest pain, and lifestyle factors such as alcohol consumption and smoking. There was a brief mention of the patient's job and concerns about returning to work, but this was not explored in depth in terms of support systems. Therefore, the student failed to determine what support is currently available to the patient."

ENCOURAGEMENT OF QUESTIONS,Case4,,"The medical student consistently encouraged the patient to ask questions and bring up additional topics throughout the interview. For example, early in the conversation, the student asked, 'Is there anything else you'd like to talk about today before we move on?' This shows an openness to additional concerns. Later, the student revisited the patient's concerns about their job and offered to discuss a work excuse, saying, 'Once we finish up the visit and we do the exam and get a better idea of what's causing your pain, I would be more than happy to speak with my preceptor and see if we can get a work excuse for you so you can have some recovery time.' At the end of the interview, the student summarized the main concerns and explicitly asked, 'Do you have any questions about what we've talked about?' and 'Any other questions that you have?' This consistent encouragement for questions and additional topics throughout the interview justifies a score of 5."
CLOSURE,Case4,,"The medical student provides a clear summary of the patient's concerns and outlines the next steps, but does not specify the timing of the next communication or appointment. The student says, 'So it sounds like your chest pain is probably related to the mountain biking accident, and we talked about getting you a note for work. And based on what I've heard from your history, it sounds like at your age and with the lifestyle you have, you're not at a terrible risk for heart disease at this time, but making some changes with cutting out alcohol and smoking, I think that that would definitely decrease your risks of heart disease in the future.' The student also mentions, 'I'll go talk with my preceptor, and you can wait here, change into a gown, and we'll be back in just a few minutes to do your physical exam.' While the student does specify what they will do next (talk with the preceptor and return for a physical exam) and what the patient should do (wait and change into a gown), the timing of the next communication or appointment is not explicitly mentioned. This results in a score of 4."
OPENING,Dental1,,"The medical student introduces herself: 'I'm Kylie Haynes.' She clarifies her role: 'I'm going to be taking a look today.' She uses the patient's name: 'Hi, Ms. Austin.' However, she does not explicitly inquire how the patient prefers to be addressed. Therefore, the introduction is missing one element, leading to a score of 4."
ELICITS SPECTRUM OF CONCERNS,Dental1,,"The medical student, Kylie Haynes, effectively elicited the patient's full spectrum of concerns within the first 3-5 minutes of the interview. The student began by asking the patient what brought her in today, which led to a discussion about the patient's chief complaint of soreness and potential abscesses in her mouth. The student then asked detailed follow-up questions about the pain, its duration, and any previous dental work, which helped to uncover secondary concerns related to the patient's dental history and potential chemical sensitivities. Additionally, the student asked about the patient's medical history, including significant medical problems, allergies, and family medical history. The student also ensured to ask if there were any other significant medical problems, which is equivalent to asking 'Anything else?' to make sure all concerns were raised. This thorough approach demonstrates that the student successfully elicited the patient's full spectrum of concerns."
NEGOTIATES PRIORITIES & SETS AGENDA,Dental1,,"The medical student did set an agenda at the onset of the interview by explaining the plan to ask questions and perform an exam: 'So probably what the plan is going to be is that I'm going to ask you a few questions. They'll probably be dental-related and medical-related just so we can kind of get an idea of what's going on. And then we'll probably just do an exam, take a look in your mouth, and see what we can do and kind of make a plan for you. Does that sound good?' However, the student did not fully elicit all of the patient's concerns at the beginning. The patient mentioned the chief complaint of soreness and potential abscesses, but the student did not ask if there were any other concerns or issues the patient wanted to address during the visit. The student did gather a comprehensive medical and dental history, but this was more about understanding the patient's background rather than negotiating the patient's priorities for the visit. Therefore, the student set an agenda but did not accomplish the complete patient agenda for their visit."
ELICITING THE NARRATIVE THREAD or the PATIENT_S STORY,Dental1,,"The medical student primarily conducted the interview in a Q&A style, which limited the patient's ability to freely narrate their story. The student frequently interrupted the patient with specific questions, which directed the conversation rather than allowing the patient to elaborate on their own. For example, after the patient mentioned, 'Well, I have a lot of soreness right here. I think it's abscessed. I'm not really sure,' the student immediately followed up with, 'It's very painful. On both sides?' This pattern continued throughout the interview, as seen when the patient started to explain their medical history related to chemical sensitivities, and the student interjected with, 'Okay. And why do you have it?' Additionally, the student introduced new information and redirected the conversation multiple times, such as when discussing the patient's dental history and the materials used for fillings. Overall, the student did not provide ample space for the patient to narrate their story without frequent interruptions and redirections."
TIMELINE,Dental1,,"The medical student, Kylie Haynes, obtained most of the information necessary to establish a chronology of the chief complaint and history of the present illness. The patient reported a throbbing pain in her lower teeth that has been persistent for about 10 days. The student confirmed this timeline multiple times: 'It's been about 10 days?' and 'And it's been about 10 days, but you had some mercury fillings, some probably amalgam, are they silver-colored?' The student also explored the patient's dental history, including the removal of mercury fillings two years ago and other dental work like wisdom teeth removal 15 years ago. However, there were minor gaps in the timeline of associated symptoms. For instance, while the student asked about the duration and nature of the pain, they did not delve deeply into whether the pain had any specific triggers or if it varied in intensity over the 10 days. Additionally, the student did not explore the onset and progression of other symptoms like the patient's chemical sensitivities in relation to her dental issues. Therefore, while the student gathered substantial information, minor gaps in the chronology of associated symptoms prevent a perfect score."
ORGANIZATION,Dental1,,"The medical student, Kylie Haynes, conducted the interview in a mostly logical and organized manner, with only occasional minor deviations. The interview began with an introduction and a clear outline of the plan, which helped set the stage for the patient. The student then moved on to the chief complaint, asking about the pain and its characteristics, duration, and potential causes. This was followed by a discussion of the patient's past dental history and medical history, which was relevant to the patient's current condition. The student also addressed the patient's concerns about chemical sensitivities and allergies, ensuring that the patient felt understood and comfortable. However, there were a few instances where the flow of the interview could have been smoother. For example, the transition from discussing the patient's dental history to the medical history was a bit abrupt: 'So I want to ask you a few questions about medical history because it seems like from your research you've kind of gotten an idea, too, that medical and dental history will be kind of related.' Additionally, the student occasionally repeated questions or asked for clarification in a way that slightly disrupted the flow, such as when discussing the duration of the pain: 'How long is the pain, like the duration of the pain?' and 'Like how long have I had it or how long does it last?' Despite these minor issues, the overall organization and time management were effective, and the student was able to gather comprehensive information within the allowed time."
TRANSITIONAL STATEMENTS,Dental1,,"The medical student, Kylie Haynes, consistently uses transitional statements throughout the interview to explain the progression from one subsection to another. For example, at the beginning, she sets the stage by saying, 'So probably what the plan is going to be is that I'm going to ask you a few questions. They'll probably be dental-related and medical-related just so we can kind of get an idea of what's going on.' This statement clearly outlines the structure of the interview. Later, she transitions to discussing the patient's dental history by saying, 'Now, what about, I'm going to ask just a little bit more about your past dental history because I've kind of got an idea about your chief complaint right now.' This effectively signals a shift in focus while providing context. Additionally, when moving to the medical history, she states, 'So now I kind of have an idea of a little bit about your dental history. So I want to ask you a few questions about medical history because it seems like from your research you've kind of gotten an idea, too, that medical and dental history will be kind of related.' These transitions are clear, informative, and help the patient understand the flow of the interview, thereby justifying a score of 5."
PACING OF INTERVIEW,Dental1,,-
QUESTIONING SKILLS TYPES OF QUESTIONS,Dental1,,"The medical student, Kylie Haynes, demonstrates a mix of open-ended and specific questions throughout the interview. She begins the information gathering with an open-ended question: 'So what brought you here today?' This is a good start. However, she often follows up with more specific or direct questions without consistently using open-ended questions to explore new lines of inquiry. For example, 'Can you describe the pain to me a little bit?' is an open-ended question, but 'How long is the pain, like the duration of the pain?' is more specific. Additionally, there are instances of multiple questions being asked together, such as 'Have you had any problems with it before this or it's just started at 10 days, 10 days ago?' and 'What kind of dental work have you had in the past? Just the wisdom teeth and a few fillings, is that about it?' These could confuse the patient. There are also leading questions like 'And did you see the dentist regularly or just when it was painful for you?' and 'So you think the problems with your teeth, you think they're related to chemical sensitivities? Is that my understanding?' which could bias the patient's responses. Overall, while there are some good open-ended questions, the frequent use of specific, multiple, and leading questions lowers the score."
QUESTIONING SKILLS SUMMARIZING,Dental1,,"The medical student consistently summarizes the data obtained at the end of each major line of inquiry, ensuring clarity and completeness. For example, after discussing the patient's chief complaint, the student summarizes: 'So just so I've got an idea, you're feeling like you have some abscesses in your mouth and they are on both sides on the lower... And it's been about 10 days, but you had some mercury fillings, some probably amalgam, are they silver-colored?' This pattern continues throughout the interview, such as when discussing the patient's medical history: 'So we have shortness of breath. We're going to try to start out with go ahead and using the oxygen while you're comfortable. You have had some chest pain that kind of comes and goes.' The student also effectively summarizes the patient's dental history and medical history before moving on to the next section, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the patient's condition. This consistent summarization demonstrates a high level of skill in verifying and clarifying information, justifying a score of 5."
QUESTIONING SKILLS DUPLICATION,Dental1,,"The medical student often repeats questions, which disrupts the flow of the interview. For example, the student asks about the duration of the pain multiple times: 'How long is the pain, like the duration of the pain?' and then 'Have you had any problems with it before this or it's just started at 10 days, 10 days ago?' Similarly, the student repeats questions about the patient's dental history: 'What kind of dental work have you had in the past? Just the wisdom teeth and a few fillings, is that about it?' and then 'So you feel like you've had dental work in the past pretty much on a regular basis. Is that correct?' Additionally, the student asks about the patient's use of baking soda twice: 'What kind of products are you using again? I know you mentioned it.' and 'Just baking soda?' These repetitions indicate a failure to remember previously provided information, leading to a disrupted interview flow."
QUESTIONING SKILLS LACK OF JARGON,Dental1,,"The medical student, Kylie Haynes, generally uses language that is easily understood by the patient and avoids excessive medical jargon. For example, she uses terms like 'throbbing pain' and 'silver-colored fillings' instead of more technical terms. However, there are instances where medical terms are used without immediate explanation, such as 'abscesses' and 'amalgam.' While the student does define 'amalgam' as 'silver-colored fillings' later, there is a slight delay. Additionally, the term 'serum' is used without explanation. Overall, the language is mostly appropriate to the patient's level of education, with minor lapses."
QUESTIONING SKILLS VERIFICATION OF PATIENT INFORMATION,Dental1,,"The medical student frequently seeks clarification, verification, and specificity of the patient's responses, demonstrating a clear pattern of following up on important details. For example, the student verifies the duration and nature of the pain ('How long is the pain, like the duration of the pain?' and 'It's been about 10 days?'). The student also clarifies the patient's dental history and the reasons for removing mercury fillings ('Why did you have the fillings removed? What do you think was the problem?'). Additionally, the student confirms the patient's allergies and medical conditions ('Are you allergic to anesthetics?' and 'Any other allergies at all that you know of?'). However, there are a few minor missed opportunities for further clarification, such as not probing deeper into the patient's chest pain and dizziness ('Chest pain. It comes and goes, so I never really know, you know, when it's going to happen.' and 'Dizziness, too. Not that often either.'). These missed opportunities are minor and do not significantly impact the overall understanding of the patient's situation, thus justifying a score of 4."
INTERACTIVE TECHNIQUES,Dental1,-,-
VERBAL FACILITATION SKILLS,Dental1,,"The medical student frequently used facilitation skills during the interview, but not as consistently or effectively as in a score of 5. The student used verbal encouragement, short statements, and echoing, but there were a few missed opportunities or inappropriate applications. For example, the student echoed the patient's statements multiple times, such as 'It's throbbing pain' and 'It's been about 10 days?' which shows active listening. However, there were moments where the student could have provided more specific verbal encouragement or asked more open-ended questions to further explore the patient's concerns. The student did provide some verbal encouragement, such as 'Okay' and 'All right,' but these were not always as timely or specific as in a top performance. Overall, the student demonstrated good facilitation skills but could improve on consistency and effectiveness."
NON-VERBAL FACILITATION SKILLS,Dental1,,-
EMPATHY AND ACKNOWLEDGING PATIENT CUES,Dental1,,"The medical student demonstrates a neutral level of empathy throughout the interview. The student acknowledges the patient's concerns and repeats back information to ensure understanding, such as 'It's very painful. On both sides?' and 'So you think it's just some chemical sensitivities to your teeth, and that's why you had the amalgam fillings removed then. Is that correct?'. However, the student misses several opportunities to express deeper empathy or use NURS techniques. For example, when the patient mentions the pain and the discomfort from chemical sensitivities, the student does not explicitly name the emotions or offer supportive comments. The student remains professional and attentive but does not go beyond basic acknowledgment to connect emotionally with the patient. The conversation is largely clinical and fact-finding, with limited attempts to address the patient's emotional experience."
PATIENTS PERSPECTIVE & BELIEFS,Dental1,,"The medical student, Kylie Haynes, made a clear effort to understand the patient's perspective and beliefs about her illness. She explored several elements of the FIFE model, including the patient's feelings about the illness (e.g., 'It's really painful'), ideas of its cause (e.g., 'I had some mercury fillings that I had taken out about two years ago'), and the impact on daily function (e.g., 'I don't go out that often, but when I do, I always take it with me' regarding the oxygen tank). The student also addressed the patient's expectations for treatment (e.g., 'We'll make sure that everything we do that you're comfortable with at first'). However, the student did not delve deeply into the patient's feelings and expectations as comprehensively as a score of 5 would require. For instance, while the student acknowledged the patient's chemical sensitivities and past experiences, there was limited exploration of the emotional impact and specific expectations for outcomes. Overall, the student showed a clear attempt to understand the patient's viewpoint but missed some depth in exploring all components of FIFE."
IMPACT OF ILLNESS ON PATIENT AND PATIENT_S SELF-IMAGE,Dental1,-,-
IMPACT OF ILLNESS ON FAMILY,Dental1,-,-
SUPPORT SYSTEMS,Dental1,,"The medical student, Kylie Haynes, made a clear attempt to understand the patient's support systems, covering both emotional and financial aspects. She asked about the patient's living situation and family support: 'Do you live with your mom, or does she live close by?' and 'So do you have a little bit of family support then at home?' The patient responded that she lives with her mother, who is 78 and affected by diabetes, indicating some level of family support but also highlighting the mother's own health issues. The student also inquired about transportation and work status: 'What about transportation? Is transportation going to be a problem or not?' and 'Do you work at all now or no?' The patient mentioned relying on friends for transportation and being on permanent disability, which touches on financial support. However, the student did not explore other community resources or suggest appropriate community resources, which is why the score is not a 5. Overall, the student addressed most aspects of patient support but did not provide a comprehensive exploration or suggestions for additional resources."

ENCOURAGEMENT OF QUESTIONS,Dental1,,"The medical student made limited attempts to allow for patient questions or additional topics. Throughout the interview, the student did not actively encourage the patient to ask questions or bring up additional points. For example, after discussing the patient's dental history, the student did not ask if the patient had any questions or additional concerns before moving on to the medical history. Similarly, after discussing the patient's medical history, the student did not provide an opportunity for the patient to ask questions or bring up additional topics. The student did acknowledge the patient's concerns and provided some reassurance, but did not actively encourage patient input. For instance, the student said, 'We'll make sure that everything we do that you're comfortable with at first. We're not going to do, you know, anything that you're not comfortable with,' but did not follow this with an invitation for questions or further discussion. Overall, the student made some attempts to address the patient's concerns but did not consistently encourage questions or additional topics."
CLOSURE,Dental1,,"The medical student partially details the plans for the future but does not provide comprehensive closure. The student mentions that they will take a look at the patient's teeth and take x-rays ('We'll go out and get everything ready. We'll probably take a couple pictures of your teeth, x-rays. Is that all right, to take some x-rays of your teeth?'), and ensures the use of non-latex gloves ('I'll make sure we use some non-latex gloves so that won't be a problem.'). However, the student does not specify what the patient should do next or when the next communication or appointment will be. The patient is left with some understanding of immediate next steps but lacks a clear sense of the overall plan and timing."
OPENING,Dental2,,"The physician introduces himself by saying, 'Good morning, Ms. Park. My name is Tom.' and uses the patient's name. However, he does not clarify his role or inquire how the patient prefers to be addressed. These missing elements are crucial for establishing a clear and respectful communication framework. Therefore, the score is 3, as the introduction is missing two key elements."
ELICITS SPECTRUM OF CONCERNS,Dental2,,"The medical student, Tom, successfully elicited the patient's chief complaint of gum bleeding and soreness, particularly when brushing teeth. He also explored the duration of the symptoms and the patient's pregnancy status, which is relevant to the chief complaint. However, Tom did not ask a final 'Anything else?' question or an equivalent to ensure all concerns were raised. Additionally, while he did inquire about the patient's medical history and medication use, he did not explicitly ask if there were any other concerns or issues the patient wanted to discuss. Therefore, the student elicited some of the patient's concerns but did not fully explore the full spectrum of concerns within the first 3-5 minutes."
NEGOTIATES PRIORITIES & SETS AGENDA,Dental2,,"The medical student did not negotiate priorities or set an agenda for the visit. The student focused solely on the chief complaint of gum bleeding and did not explore any other potential concerns the patient might have had. The conversation was driven by the physician's questions and explanations, without any effort to list or prioritize the patient's concerns. For example, the physician started with, 'What brings you into the dental clinic today?' and then immediately delved into the details of the gum bleeding without asking if there were any other issues the patient wanted to discuss. The student also did not seek the patient's agreement on the agenda for the visit. The entire interaction was centered around the physician's need to address the gum bleeding and provide information about its connection to pregnancy, without considering a broader spectrum of patient concerns."
ELICITING THE NARRATIVE THREAD or the PATIENT_S STORY,Dental2,,"The medical student primarily conducted the interview in a Q&A style, which limited the patient's ability to freely narrate her story. The student frequently interrupted the patient with specific questions and introduced new information, which directed the flow of the conversation. For example, after the patient mentioned bleeding gums, the student immediately asked, 'Are you feeling any pain with that bleeding?' and continued with a series of focused questions. Additionally, the student introduced new topics such as the patient's pregnancy and medical history without allowing the patient to elaborate on her initial concern. This approach is evident when the student says, 'Now it says in your chart here that you're pregnant?' and 'Do you have any significant medical problems right now?' These interruptions and the structured Q&A format indicate a score of 2, as the student did not facilitate a conversational flow that would allow the patient to fully express her narrative."
TIMELINE,Dental2,,"The medical student did a commendable job in establishing a timeline for the chief complaint and the history of the present illness. The patient mentioned that the gum bleeding had been occurring for 'a couple of weeks,' which the student confirmed. The student also identified that the bleeding and soreness primarily occurred during tooth brushing and occasionally during the day. However, there were minor gaps in the chronology of associated symptoms. For instance, the student did not delve into whether the symptoms had worsened, improved, or remained consistent over the couple of weeks. Additionally, while the student explored the patient's dental history and previous treatments, they did not establish a clear timeline for the onset of the current symptoms in relation to the patient's pregnancy. Overall, the student gathered most of the necessary information but missed some details that could have provided a more comprehensive timeline."
ORGANIZATION,Dental2,,"The medical student demonstrated a mostly logical and organized approach throughout the interview. The conversation began with a clear introduction and an open-ended question about the patient's reason for the visit, which is a good practice. The student then followed up with relevant questions about the symptoms, duration, and context of the bleeding gums, as well as the patient's pregnancy status, which is pertinent to the condition discussed. For example, the student asked, 'How long is this bleeding, gums? How long have they been going on?' and 'Are you feeling any pain with that bleeding?'. These questions were logical and flowed well from one to the next. The student also provided a clear explanation of the potential link between pregnancy and gingivitis, which was well-received by the patient. However, there were a few minor deviations and some sections that felt slightly extended, such as the detailed discussion about cultural practices and the patient's concerns about anesthesia. While these were important topics, they could have been more succinctly addressed to maintain a tighter flow. For instance, the conversation about cultural practices and the use of girdles to prevent the fetus from getting too large was somewhat tangential: 'But what I'm doing now is I put on some girdles, two kind of band-aid thing, to tighten up my belly to prevent my fetus getting fatter.' Overall, the interview was well-organized, but the flow was not as seamless as it could have been, which is why it merits a score of 4."

PACING OF INTERVIEW,Dental2,,-
QUESTIONING SKILLS TYPES OF QUESTIONS,Dental2,,"The medical student demonstrated a mix of open-ended and specific questions throughout the interview. The initial question, 'What brings you into the dental clinic today?' is a good open-ended question. However, the student frequently used specific or direct questions to gather information, such as 'Are you feeling any pain with that bleeding?' and 'How far along are you?' These are appropriate but not open-ended. The student also used some leading questions, such as 'Nothing you know of? No history of diabetes, high blood pressure, cancer, anything like that?' and 'You do not at all? Okay. You haven't used any illicit drugs such as marijuana or cocaine?' which could influence the patient's responses. There were no 'why' questions or multiple questions, which is positive. Overall, the student often failed to begin a line of inquiry with open-ended questions but did not excessively use poor question types."
QUESTIONING SKILLS SUMMARIZING,Dental2,,"The medical student did not summarize the data obtained at any point during the interview. The conversation flowed continuously without any clear summarization of the patient's history, symptoms, or concerns. For example, after discussing the patient's gum bleeding and its potential link to pregnancy, the student did not summarize this information to ensure clarity. Similarly, after discussing the patient's oral hygiene habits and cultural practices, there was no summarization to confirm understanding. The student also missed opportunities to summarize after discussing the treatment plan and the potential need for deep cleaning. The lack of summarization could lead to misunderstandings or missed information, which is critical in a medical setting."
QUESTIONING SKILLS DUPLICATION,Dental2,-,-
QUESTIONING SKILLS LACK OF JARGON,Dental2,,"The medical student generally used language that was easily understood by the patient and avoided excessive medical jargon. For example, the student explained terms like 'gingivitis' and 'plaque' in simple terms: 'Sometimes the body's response against the bacteria with the hormones can be inflammation and can cause gingivitis.' However, there were instances where the student used terms like 'periodontal exam' and 'quadrants' without immediate explanation, which could be confusing for a patient without medical knowledge. The student did a good job of explaining the relationship between pregnancy and gum disease, but there were moments where the explanations could have been simplified further or clarified sooner. Overall, the language used was mostly appropriate to the patient's level of education, with minor lapses."
QUESTIONING SKILLS VERIFICATION OF PATIENT INFORMATION,Dental2,,"The medical student frequently seeks clarification, verification, and specificity of the patient's responses, demonstrating a clear pattern of following up on important details. For example, when the patient mentions she is about 20 weeks pregnant, the student verifies by repeating, 'About 20 weeks?' Similarly, when discussing the duration of gum bleeding, the student confirms, 'A couple of weeks?' The student also clarifies the patient's brushing and flossing habits and verifies the patient's medical history and medication use. However, there are a few minor missed opportunities for further clarification. For instance, when the patient mentions using girdles to prevent the fetus from getting fatter, the student does not delve deeper into understanding the potential implications or safety of this practice. Overall, the student demonstrates a strong ability to seek clarification and verification, with only minor gaps that do not significantly impact the overall understanding of the patient's situation."
INTERACTIVE TECHNIQUES,Dental2,-,-
VERBAL FACILITATION SKILLS,Dental2,,"The medical student demonstrated some facilitative skills but did not consistently use them throughout the interview. The student asked open-ended questions and provided explanations, but there were missed opportunities for verbal encouragement and echoing. For example, the student did not acknowledge the patient's concerns about anesthesia affecting the baby with empathetic statements. Instead, the student provided factual information without much emotional support: 'I can completely understand that you don't want to put chemicals in your body with your belief system and whatnot during the pregnancy.' Additionally, the student did not use short statements or echoing to encourage the patient to elaborate on her feelings and concerns. The conversation was more focused on providing information rather than facilitating a two-way dialogue. Therefore, the student's performance aligns with a score of 3, as there was some use of facilitative skills but not consistently or effectively."
NON-VERBAL FACILITATION SKILLS,Dental2,,-
EMPATHY AND ACKNOWLEDGING PATIENT CUES,Dental2,,"The medical student demonstrates limited attempts at empathy, but these are infrequent and sometimes poorly executed. The student provides thorough explanations and addresses the patient's concerns, but there are missed opportunities to connect emotionally and show deeper empathy. For example, when the patient expresses concern about the safety of anesthesia for her baby, the student responds with factual information but does not acknowledge the patient's anxiety or offer reassurance in a supportive manner. The student says, 'I can completely understand that you don't want to put chemicals in your body with your belief system and whatnot during the pregnancy,' which shows some understanding but lacks warmth and emotional connection. Additionally, the student does not use NURS techniques or equivalent methods to demonstrate empathy consistently. Overall, the student's approach is somewhat detached and focused more on providing information than on addressing the patient's emotional needs."
PATIENTS PERSPECTIVE & BELIEFS,Dental2,,"The medical student made a clear effort to elicit the patient's perspectives and beliefs, covering several elements of FIFE, but not all comprehensively. The student explored the patient's ideas about the cause of her gum bleeding, explaining the link between pregnancy and gingivitis. The student also asked about the patient's cultural practices and beliefs related to pregnancy, such as the use of Chinese tea and girdles to manage the baby's size and the mother's body figure. The student addressed the patient's concerns about medication and anesthesia affecting her baby, showing an understanding of her expectations and fears. However, the student did not deeply explore the patient's feelings about her illness or the impact on her daily function. For example, the student did not ask how the gum bleeding affects her daily life or emotional well-being. Direct quotes supporting this evaluation include: 'What is generally done during the pregnancy in terms of beliefs that are thought to be good for the baby, to keep the baby healthy?' and 'Do you have any concerns about stressing the baby while you're in the chair?' These questions show an attempt to understand the patient's perspective, but a more comprehensive exploration of all FIFE elements would have warranted a score of 5."
IMPACT OF ILLNESS ON PATIENT AND PATIENT_S SELF-IMAGE,Dental2,-,-
IMPACT OF ILLNESS ON FAMILY,Dental2,-,-
SUPPORT SYSTEMS,Dental2,,"The medical student made some attempts to explore the patient's support systems but did not cover all necessary aspects comprehensively. The student asked about the patient's living situation and who she consults for health decisions: 'Generally, who do you consult with for your health decisions? Do you have someone, like, are you married? Do you have any family members other than your husband?' and 'I live with my husband and parents-in-law.' This shows an attempt to understand the patient's emotional support. However, the student did not explore financial support or other resources available to the patient. There was no discussion about the patient's access to healthcare or any community resources that might be available to her. Therefore, the student determined some of the available support but did not provide a comprehensive exploration."
PATIENTS EDUCATION AND UNDERSTANDING,Dental2,,"The medical student demonstrated a thorough approach to ensuring the patient's understanding and addressing her concerns. The student used several deliberate techniques to check the patient's comprehension, such as asking her to repeat information ('So do you understand everything that I'm telling you about? Could you just tell me what you think that I'm telling you, just so we're both on the same page?'). The student also addressed the patient's concerns about anesthesia and its effects on the fetus by providing scientific evidence and reassurance ('Yes, we have a lot of scientific evidence that anesthetic is safe...'). Additionally, the student explored the patient's cultural practices and beliefs, which could impact her health decisions ('And this tea, is it commonly done in your culture, in your Korean, correct?'). The student also made sure to ask if the patient had any other questions or concerns multiple times throughout the interview ('Do you have any other concerns or problems with the treatment that we're going to be giving?' and 'Do you have any other questions for me today?'). Overall, the student effectively ensured the patient's understanding and provided appropriate education tailored to her needs."

ENCOURAGEMENT OF QUESTIONS,Dental2,,"The medical student did a commendable job of encouraging the patient to ask questions and discuss additional points throughout the interview. For instance, the student responded to the patient's request for a slower explanation about the correlation between pregnancy and gingivitis: 'Sure. No problem. When you're pregnant, your body is producing hormones such as estrogen and progesterone in high levels.' The student also addressed the patient's concerns about anesthesia and its effects on the fetus: 'Sure. When we give you the anesthesia, we will keep it just in the area of your mouth that we're working on, and we'll try to give you as little as possible to make it effective.' Additionally, the student asked, 'Do you have any other concerns or problems with the treatment that we're going to be giving?' and 'Do you have any other questions for me today?' These instances show a clear attempt to be open to patient input. However, the student did not consistently encourage questions at the end of every major subsection, which is why the score is not a perfect 5."
CLOSURE,Dental2,,"The medical student clearly specifies the future plans at the end of the interview. The student outlines what they will do next ('we're going to do a complete periodontal exam on you'), what the patient will do ('you need to come in for...one visit for a general cleaning...and then one visit for each quadrant that we decide you need a deep cleaning on'), and provides a clear timeline ('the most amount of visits that we're looking at is five...the least amount is one...we'll be able to tell you that at the end of today's visit'). This comprehensive closure ensures the patient knows exactly what to expect moving forward."
OPENING,Dental3,,"The physician uses the patient's name ('Hey, Kevin') but does not introduce themselves, clarify their role, or inquire how to address the patient. The conversation starts with a basic greeting and familiarity, but it lacks the formal elements of a proper introduction. Therefore, the score is 2, as the introduction is missing three key elements and only a basic greeting is present."
ELICITS SPECTRUM OF CONCERNS,Dental3,,"The medical student did a commendable job of eliciting the patient's chief complaint and secondary concerns within the first 3-5 minutes of the interview. The student asked about the patient's general well-being, oral hygiene, and any recent health issues. For instance, the student inquired, 'Have you been having any problems since you were last here for your last visit?' and 'How about your general health? Have there been any changes in your health since you were last here?' This led to the patient revealing issues like occasional gum bleeding, shortness of breath, and a recent episode of bronchitis. However, the student did not ask a final 'Anything else?' or an equivalent question to ensure all concerns were raised, which is why the score is a 4 instead of a 5."
NEGOTIATES PRIORITIES & SETS AGENDA,Dental3,,"The physician minimally negotiates priorities and fails to accomplish the complete patient agenda. Limited efforts are made to set an agenda. The physician does not explicitly list all of the patient's concerns or set a clear agenda at the onset of the interview. The conversation is more reactive to the patient's responses rather than proactively setting an agenda. For example, the physician asks, 'Have you been having any problems since you were last here for your last visit?' and 'How about your general health? Have there been any changes in your health since you were last here?' but does not follow up with a structured plan or agenda for the visit. The focus shifts to smoking cessation without a clear negotiation of other potential concerns the patient might have. The physician does not get the patient's agreement to an agenda, which is a key component of higher scores."
ELICITING THE NARRATIVE THREAD or the PATIENT_S STORY,Dental3,,"The physician primarily conducted the interview in a Q&A style, which limited the patient's ability to freely narrate their story. While the physician did ask open-ended questions initially, such as 'How's everything going for you?' and 'Have you been having any problems since you were last here for your last visit?', the conversation quickly shifted to a more structured format with the physician asking specific questions and the patient providing brief answers. For example, the physician asked, 'How often have you been brushing?' and 'Have you seen your physician recently?', which are focused questions that guide the conversation rather than allowing the patient to elaborate on their own. Additionally, the physician introduced new information frequently, such as discussing the benefits of quitting smoking and various cessation methods, which further directed the conversation away from the patient's narrative. Overall, the physician did not create a conversational environment that encouraged the patient to freely discuss their concerns and experiences."
TIMELINE,Dental3,,"The medical student obtained limited information about the chronology of the chief complaint and history of the present illness. Significant gaps exist in the timeline, and the chronology of most associated symptoms is not established. The student did not delve deeply into the timeline of the patient's symptoms. For example, the patient mentioned 'occasional bleeding of the gums' and 'a few weeks ago I had an episode of bronchitis,' but the student did not ask for specific dates or durations for these symptoms. Additionally, the student did not explore the timeline of the patient's shortness of breath in detail, such as when it started, how long it lasts, or if it has been getting worse. The conversation focused more on the patient's smoking habits and plans to quit rather than establishing a detailed chronology of the present illness."
ORGANIZATION,Dental3,,"The medical student demonstrated excellent organization throughout the interview. The conversation began with a friendly greeting and a brief personal update, which helped build rapport. The student then smoothly transitioned into updating the patient's medical history, addressing oral hygiene, general health, and specific symptoms like shortness of breath. The discussion about smoking cessation was thorough and logically structured, covering the patient's smoking habits, previous quit attempts, available cessation methods, and strategies for dealing with cravings. The student also provided practical advice and support, ensuring the patient felt prepared and motivated to quit smoking. The interview flowed seamlessly, with no noticeable jumps between topics, and time was used effectively to cover all necessary points. For example, the student said, 'Before Kathy comes in to do your prophy, I wanted to just update your history,' which clearly signaled a transition to the medical history update. The detailed discussion about smoking cessation products and strategies was well-organized and comprehensive, demonstrating excellent time management and logical flow."
TRANSITIONAL STATEMENTS,Dental3,-,-
PACING OF INTERVIEW,Dental3,,-
QUESTIONING SKILLS TYPES OF QUESTIONS,Dental3,,"The physician begins the conversation with an open-ended question, 'How's everything going for you?' which is a good start. However, the physician often follows up with more specific or direct questions rather than continuing with open-ended questions. For example, 'Have you and your wife thought about any names yet for the baby?' and 'Have you been having any problems since you were last here for your last visit?' are specific questions. The physician also uses a few leading questions, such as 'And your wife is on you to quit also?' and 'Do you think you would want to quit, do you think?' Additionally, there is a 'why' question: 'Why do you think that happened?' when discussing the patient's previous attempts to quit smoking. These elements indicate that while the physician does use some open-ended questions, they often rely on specific or direct questions and occasionally use poor question types, which aligns with a score of 3."
QUESTIONING SKILLS SUMMARIZING,Dental3,,"The physician did not summarize the data obtained at any point during the interview. The conversation flowed continuously without any clear summarization of the patient's history, symptoms, or concerns. For example, after discussing the patient's oral hygiene and general health, the physician did not summarize the key points before moving on to the next topic. Similarly, after discussing the patient's smoking habits and desire to quit, there was no summarization to ensure all information was accurately captured and understood. The physician's approach lacked the necessary summarization to verify and clarify the information gathered, which is essential for a complete and accurate patient history."
QUESTIONING SKILLS DUPLICATION,Dental3,,"The medical student generally avoids repeating questions unnecessarily and maintains a good flow throughout the interview. However, there are a few instances where questions are repeated, though they seem to be for clarification or to ensure thoroughness. For example, the physician asks, 'Have you been having any problems since you were last here for your last visit?' and then later asks, 'How about your general health? Have there been any changes in your health since you were last here?' These questions are similar but serve to cover different aspects of the patient's health. Additionally, the physician repeats, 'Do you think at this point that you're willing to set an actual quit date, say, within the next month?' and 'Would that be a reasonable time frame for you?' which are closely related but aim to confirm the patient's commitment. Overall, the repetition is minimal and seems to be for clarification, justifying a score of 4."
QUESTIONING SKILLS LACK OF JARGON,Dental3,,"The medical student generally uses language that is easily understood and avoids excessive medical jargon. For example, the student uses terms like 'shortness of breath' instead of 'dyspnea' and 'tobacco stains' instead of 'nicotine-induced discoloration.' However, there are instances where medical terms are used without immediate explanation. For instance, the term 'prophy' is used without clarification, which might not be immediately understood by the patient. Additionally, terms like 'bronchitis' and 'risk factor' are used without immediate layman explanations. Despite these minor lapses, the student mostly defines terms when necessary and uses language appropriate to the patient's level of education."

INTERACTIVE TECHNIQUES,Dental3,-,-
VERBAL FACILITATION SKILLS,Dental3,,"The medical student frequently uses facilitation skills throughout the interview, but there are a few missed opportunities and some areas where the application could be more effective. The student provides verbal encouragement and uses short statements and echoing, but not as consistently as in a top performance. For example, the student echoes the patient's concerns and provides encouragement: 'That's fantastic. Congratulations.' and 'That's great. And your wife is on you to quit also?' However, there are moments where the student could have provided more timely or specific encouragement, such as when the patient mentions the stress of quitting smoking. Overall, the student demonstrates a strong use of facilitation skills but falls short of the highest level of consistency and effectiveness."
NON-VERBAL FACILITATION SKILLS,Dental3,,-
EMPATHY AND ACKNOWLEDGING PATIENT CUES,Dental3,,"The physician consistently demonstrates empathy and acknowledges the patient's emotions and concerns throughout the interview. The physician uses supportive comments and NURS techniques effectively. For example, when the patient shares the news about expecting a baby, the physician responds with, 'That's fantastic. Congratulations,' and later adds, 'I've known you a long time, Kevin, so I have no doubt you're going to be a great dad.' This shows understanding and respect for the patient's experience. Additionally, the physician acknowledges the patient's efforts to quit smoking and provides encouragement, saying, 'That's great. That's fantastic,' and 'Well, that's great. And your wife is on you to quit also?' The physician also offers practical advice and support, such as suggesting distractions for cravings and emphasizing the importance of a support system. Overall, the physician's approach is empathetic, supportive, and patient-centered, warranting a score of 5."
PATIENTS PERSPECTIVE & BELIEFS,Dental3,,"The physician makes limited attempts to elicit the patient's perspective on their illness and healing practices. While the physician does address the patient's smoking habits and provides extensive information on quitting, they do not deeply explore the patient's Feelings, Ideas, Function, and Expectations (FIFE) regarding their health and smoking. For example, the physician does not ask about the patient's feelings towards their shortness of breath or bronchitis, nor do they explore the patient's ideas about the cause of these symptoms. The physician also does not inquire about how these symptoms impact the patient's daily function or what the patient expects from treatment. The conversation is more focused on providing information rather than understanding the patient's perspective. Quotes to support this include: 'Have you been having any problems since you were last here for your last visit?' and 'Do you have any suggestions as to how to do that? Because I'm anticipating some really strong ones.' These show some awareness of the patient's viewpoint but lack depth in exploring the patient's beliefs and experiences."

IMPACT OF ILLNESS ON FAMILY,Dental3,-,-
SUPPORT SYSTEMS,Dental3,,"The medical student did a commendable job in exploring the patient's support systems, particularly in the context of smoking cessation. The student addressed the emotional support by discussing the patient's wife and friends: 'Do you have support?' and 'my wife doesn't smoke, so she's definitely going to be happy and helpful.' The student also touched on the financial aspect by discussing the cost of smoking cessation products and insurance coverage: 'Some insurance plans do cover the cost of the medications and even the nicotine replacement products.' However, the student did not delve deeply into other resources available to the patient or suggest community resources. Therefore, while the exploration was thorough in some areas, it was not comprehensive enough to warrant a score of 5."
PATIENTS EDUCATION AND UNDERSTANDING,Dental3,,"The physician demonstrated a comprehensive approach to ensuring the patient's understanding and provided thorough education throughout the interview. The physician used multiple techniques to check the patient's understanding, such as asking if the patient had any questions ('Any questions that you have at this point?'), and offering to provide additional information ('If you do have any questions after you go through the material, please make sure to give me a call.'). The physician also provided detailed explanations about the risks of smoking, the benefits of quitting, and the various cessation methods available ('You're probably already aware that it's a risk factor for a lot of significant medical problems...'). Additionally, the physician tailored the education to the patient's specific situation, such as discussing the impact of smoking on the upcoming baby and providing practical tips for dealing with cravings ('So if you're in the car driving, turn the radio on. Sing along with the radio.'). The physician also offered to follow up with the patient to support their quit attempt ('So then what I'll do is I'll plan on calling you, say, within a couple of days.'). Overall, the physician's approach was thorough, patient-centered, and supportive, meeting the criteria for a score of 5."
ASSESS MOTIVATION FOR CHANGES,Dental3,,"The physician thoroughly assessed the patient's motivation for quitting smoking and provided a comprehensive range of options and plans to support the change. The physician explored the patient's feelings about quitting, acknowledged the patient's concerns, and offered various methods to quit smoking, including medications and nicotine replacement products. The physician also discussed potential triggers and coping strategies, emphasizing the importance of a support system. For example, the physician said, 'Sometimes it's actually helpful to keep a log of when you smoke and when you get your cravings,' and 'You have to sort of anticipate in advance what your triggers are going to be, what's going to set off a craving for you, and sort of come up with a plan.' Additionally, the physician suggested setting a quit date and provided practical advice on preparing for it, such as cleaning out ashtrays and informing others about the quit attempt. This comprehensive approach aligns with the criteria for a score of 5."

QUESTIONING SKILLS TYPES OF QUESTIONS,4,"The medical student, Cheyenne, begins the information gathering with an open-ended question: 'So what brings you into the office today?' This is a strong start and sets the tone for the rest of the interview. Throughout the conversation, Cheyenne mostly uses open-ended questions to explore different aspects of the patient's history and concerns. For example, 'Tell me why you want to start an exercise program,' 'Have you thought at all about types of exercise that you might be interested in?' and 'Tell me about your exercise history. Have you ever exercised routinely?' These questions allow the patient to provide detailed responses and guide the conversation. However, there are instances where Cheyenne uses more specific or direct questions to gather information, such as 'How old are you, Velma?' and 'Do you take anything for it?' While these are necessary for obtaining specific details, they slightly reduce the overall score. Additionally, there are very few poor question types used, with no leading, why, or multiple questions evident. Overall, Cheyenne demonstrates strong questioning skills with a good balance of open-ended and specific questions, justifying a score of 4."
QUESTIONING SKILLS SUMMARIZING,5,"The medical student consistently summarizes the data obtained at the end of each major line of inquiry, ensuring clarity and completeness of the patient's history. For example, after discussing the patient's interest in starting an exercise program and her medical history, the student summarizes: 'So you are interested in starting an exercise program because you've been a little bit more tired lately and you think it might be due to lack of exercise. And you've thought a little bit about starting a program. And I've asked you about your medical history, so I know that you do have high cholesterol.' This summary is accurate and helps to verify the information. Additionally, at the end of the interview, the student provides a comprehensive summary of the plan: 'So just to make sure that I explained that clearly, I know I was a little jumbled in what I was saying, could you tell me what we just agreed upon and what you got from that?' The patient then recaps the plan, confirming understanding. The student's consistent and accurate summarization throughout the interview meets the criteria for a score of 5."
QUESTIONING SKILLS DUPLICATION,Not scored,Not in mapping_items_to_score
QUESTIONING SKILLS LACK OF JARGON,5,"The medical student consistently used language that was easily understood by the patient and avoided medical jargon throughout the interview. For example, instead of using the term 'hyperlipidemia,' the student referred to it as 'high cholesterol,' which is more commonly understood. When discussing medications, the student used the brand name 'Lipitor' rather than the generic name 'atorvastatin,' which is more familiar to most patients. The student also ensured that the patient understood the benefits of exercise in simple terms, such as 'Exercise is very good for your heart health, for your lung health, pretty much total body health.' Additionally, the student used phrases like 'back disc' instead of 'herniated disc,' which is more technical. The language used was appropriate to the patient's level of education and understanding, and the student made sure to clarify and confirm understanding, as seen when the student asked, 'So just to make sure that I explained that clearly, I know I was a little jumbled in what I was saying, could you tell me what we just agreed upon and what you got from that?' This approach ensured that the patient was fully informed and comfortable with the information provided."
QUESTIONING SKILLS VERIFICATION OF PATIENT INFORMATION,4,"The medical student frequently seeks clarification, verification, and specificity of the patient's responses, demonstrating a clear pattern of following up on important details. For example, when the patient mentioned taking Lipitor, the student asked, 'Do you know how long you've been on that?' and 'When was the last time you saw your doctor?' This shows an effort to gather specific information. Additionally, the student verified the patient's understanding of the plan by asking, 'So just to make sure that I explained that clearly, I know I was a little jumbled in what I was saying, could you tell me what we just agreed upon and what you got from that?' However, there were a few minor missed opportunities for further clarification, such as not probing deeper into the patient's tiredness over the past year or the specifics of her back pain. These missed opportunities are minor and do not significantly impact the overall understanding of the patient's situation, thus justifying a score of 4."
VERBAL FACILITATION SKILLS,4,"The medical student frequently used facilitation skills throughout the interview, but there were a few missed opportunities for more effective engagement. The student provided verbal encouragement and used short statements to keep the conversation flowing. For example, the student said, 'I'm glad you came in. We can certainly talk about that,' and 'My guess is that it will,' which are encouraging and supportive. The student also echoed the patient's concerns and statements, such as 'So you are interested in starting an exercise program because you've been a little bit more tired lately and you think it might be due to lack of exercise.' However, there were moments where the student could have used more specific verbal encouragement or asked more open-ended questions to delve deeper into the patient's feelings and motivations. Overall, the student demonstrated a good use of facilitation skills but could improve consistency and effectiveness to achieve a top score."
EMPATHY AND ACKNOWLEDGING PATIENT CUES,3,"The medical student demonstrated a neutral level of empathy throughout the interview. While the student was polite and attentive, there were limited explicit attempts to connect emotionally with the patient or to acknowledge her feelings deeply. For example, when the patient mentioned being tired for almost a year, the student responded with 'My guess is that it will,' which is supportive but lacks depth in understanding the patient's emotional state. Additionally, when the patient expressed concerns about her varicose veins and reluctance to go to the gym, the student acknowledged it but did not delve deeper into how the patient felt about it. The student did not employ NURS techniques or equivalent methods to a significant extent. Overall, the student maintained a professional and neutral tone but missed opportunities for deeper empathy."
PATIENTS PERSPECTIVE & BELIEFS,3,"The medical student made some attempts to elicit the patient's perspective on her illness and exercise goals but did not fully explore all aspects of FIFE (Feelings, Ideas, Function, Expectations). The student asked about the patient's ideas on the cause of her tiredness ('Do you have any ideas as to what it might be?'), and the impact on her daily function ('Run me through a typical day for you'). However, the student did not delve deeply into the patient's feelings about her tiredness or her expectations for the exercise program. The conversation was more focused on gathering medical history and logistical details rather than understanding the patient's beliefs and emotional state. Therefore, the student demonstrated some awareness of the importance of the patient's viewpoint but did not comprehensively address it."
IMPACT OF ILLNESS ON PATIENT AND PATIENT_S SELF-IMAGE,3,"The medical student partially addresses the impact of the illness on the patientâ€™s life and self-image. The student acknowledges the patient's tiredness and its potential link to lack of exercise, and they discuss the patient's concerns about varicose veins and discomfort with gym environments. However, the student does not deeply explore the emotional or psychological impact of these issues on the patient's self-image or daily life. The student offers practical advice and a plan for starting an exercise routine but does not provide counseling or resources to help with the patient's self-image concerns. For example, the student says, 'We'll keep that in mind, too, when we eventually talk about what exactly we should be doing,' but does not delve deeper into how the varicose veins affect the patient's self-esteem or offer specific support for this issue."
SUPPORT SYSTEMS,5,"The medical student thoroughly explored the patient's support systems across multiple dimensions. They inquired about emotional support by asking about the patient's family and who she lives with: 'Tell me something about your family. Who do you live with?' and 'How about family in the area? Do you have any other family members around?' They also discussed the patient's husband and his potential involvement in the exercise program: 'Do you think he would be at all interested in exercising with you?' and 'Do you think you'd like to exercise with someone, or do you see yourself exercising by yourself?' The student addressed financial support by asking about any financial concerns related to gym membership: 'Now, gyms can be somewhat of a financial burden. Do you have any financial concerns?' and confirmed that the patient has insurance: 'And do you have insurance?' Additionally, the student explored other resources by suggesting community resources like gyms and personal trainers: 'Now, gyms can be somewhat of a financial burden. Do you have any financial concerns?' and 'At the gym, another benefit is that they often have personal trainers.' The student also suggested involving the patient's daughter in the exercise program: 'Is there anyone else who lives nearby that you think would be willing to exercise with you?' and 'So how about we think about your starting a gym program and talking to your daughter, Lucy, and trying to get her involved in that with you.' Overall, the student demonstrated a comprehensive understanding of the patient's support systems and provided relevant suggestions."
PATIENTS EDUCATION AND UNDERSTANDING,5,"The medical student demonstrated a thorough and deliberate approach to ensuring the patient's understanding and addressing patient education. The student used several techniques to check comprehension, such as summarizing the plan and asking the patient to repeat it back: 'So just to make sure that I explained that clearly, I know I was a little jumbled in what I was saying, could you tell me what we just agreed upon and what you got from that?' The patient was able to accurately repeat the plan, indicating understanding: 'That I'm going to start at the gym that has the pool and go to that and see if my daughter and or my husband would like to do that and or go to the regular gym and have the personal trainer show me some of the bikes and things that they have and how to use them.' Additionally, the student provided detailed information about the benefits of exercise and tailored the discussion to the patient's interests and concerns, such as her varicose veins and back pain. The student also suggested involving family members to support the patient's exercise routine, demonstrating an understanding of the patient's social context. Overall, the student effectively ensured comprehension and provided appropriate education, meeting the criteria for a score of 5."
ASSESS MOTIVATION FOR CHANGES,5,"The medical student did an excellent job of assessing the patient's motivation for change and offering a range of options and plans to support the change. The student inquired about the patient's feelings and reasons for wanting to start an exercise program: 'So tell me why you want to start an exercise program.' The student also explored the patient's preferences and concerns, such as her interest in swimming and her discomfort with varicose veins: 'Have you thought at all about types of exercise that you might be interested in?' and 'Though you mentioned varicose veins. Do you think you'd be less worried about those if your daughter were with you?' The student provided a detailed plan that included involving family members, using a gym with a personal trainer, and considering the patient's back pain: 'How about we think about your starting a gym program and talking to your daughter, Lucy, and trying to get her involved in that with you.' The student also set a follow-up plan to reassess and adjust the exercise routine: 'And how about I make a follow-up appointment with you for a month from now to talk about how it's going.' Overall, the student demonstrated a comprehensive approach to supporting the patient's lifestyle change."
ACHIEVE A SHARED PLAN,5,"The medical student, Cheyenne, thoroughly discusses the patient's desire to start an exercise program, taking into account her medical history, personal preferences, and potential barriers. Cheyenne invites the patient, Velma, to contribute her thoughts and preferences throughout the conversation. For example, Cheyenne asks, 'Have you thought at all about types of exercise that you might be interested in?' and 'Do you think you'd like to exercise with someone, or do you see yourself exercising by yourself?' This shows an effort to involve Velma in the decision-making process. Additionally, Cheyenne negotiates a plan that includes checking with a physical therapist about Velma's back pain, discussing the possibility of exercising with her daughter and husband, and setting a follow-up appointment to review progress. The student also ensures Velma understands the plan by asking her to repeat it back: 'So just to make sure that I explained that clearly, I know I was a little jumbled in what I was saying, could you tell me what we just agreed upon and what you got from that?' This comprehensive approach and active involvement of the patient in planning justify a score of 5."
ENCOURAGEMENT OF QUESTIONS,2,"The medical student made limited attempts to allow for patient questions or additional topics. While the student did ask if there were any other concerns at the beginning ('Is there anything else that you're concerned about?'), there were no consistent efforts to encourage questions or additional topics throughout the interview. The student did not actively encourage the patient to ask questions at the end of major subsections or at the conclusion of the interview. The opportunity for the patient to discuss additional topics was minimal, and the student did not create a clear space for the patient to bring up new points or questions."
CLOSURE,5,"The medical student provided a comprehensive and clear plan for the future at the end of the interview. The student specified what actions they would take, what the patient should do, and the timing for the next steps. Specifically, the student mentioned: (1) 'I'll let you talk to your family members and we'll set you up for an appointment within the next week,' (2) 'I'll let you start on the exercise program in about a week,' and (3) 'How about I make a follow-up appointment with you for a month from now to talk about how it's going.' This detailed plan covers the student's actions, the patient's actions, and the timing of the next communication or appointment, fulfilling all the criteria for a score of 5."
ELICITS SPECTRUM OF CONCERNS,5,"The medical student successfully elicited the patient's full spectrum of concerns within the first 3-5 minutes of the interview. The student asked the patient what brought her into the office and followed up with 'Is there anything else that you're concerned about?' (Physician: 'So what brings you into the office today?' Patient: 'Well, I'm wanting to do something with exercise, and I'm not really sure what I want to do or why even to do it.' Physician: 'Okay. Well, then I'm glad you came in. We can certainly talk about that. Is there anything else that you're concerned about?' Patient: 'No.'). This ensured that all of the patient's concerns were addressed early in the conversation."
NEGOTIATES PRIORITIES & SETS AGENDA,5,"The medical student, Cheyenne, fully negotiates the priorities of the patient's concerns and sets a clear agenda at the onset of the interview. Cheyenne begins by asking the patient what brings her into the office and then explicitly asks if there are any other concerns: 'Is there anything else that you're concerned about?' The patient responds with 'No,' indicating that the primary concern is the exercise program. Cheyenne then outlines the plan for the visit: 'So then what I'm going to do is I'm going to ask you a few questions to get a medical history and some reasons behind your wanting to do an exercise program, and then we can get into talking about how to start that. Does that sound okay?' The patient agrees, showing that Cheyenne has successfully set the agenda and obtained the patient's agreement. Throughout the interview, Cheyenne revisits and confirms the patient's priorities, ensuring that the discussion remains focused on the patient's concerns and goals. This thorough approach aligns with the criteria for a score of 5."

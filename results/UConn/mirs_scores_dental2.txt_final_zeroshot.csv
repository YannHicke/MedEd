OPENING,3,"The physician introduces himself by saying, 'Good morning, Ms. Park. My name is Tom.' and uses the patient's name. However, he does not clarify his role or inquire how the patient prefers to be addressed. These missing elements are crucial for establishing a clear and respectful communication framework. Therefore, the score is 3, as the introduction is missing two key elements."
ELICITS SPECTRUM OF CONCERNS,3,"The medical student, Tom, successfully elicited the patient's chief complaint of gum bleeding and soreness, particularly when brushing teeth. He also explored the duration of the symptoms and the patient's pregnancy status, which is relevant to the chief complaint. However, Tom did not ask a final 'Anything else?' question or an equivalent to ensure all concerns were raised. Additionally, while he did inquire about the patient's medical history and medication use, he did not explicitly ask if there were any other concerns or issues the patient wanted to discuss. Therefore, the student elicited some of the patient's concerns but did not fully explore the full spectrum of concerns within the first 3-5 minutes."
ELICITING THE NARRATIVE THREAD or the PATIENT_S STORY,2,"The medical student primarily conducted the interview in a Q&A style, which limited the patient's ability to freely narrate her story. The student frequently interrupted the patient with specific questions and introduced new information, which directed the flow of the conversation. For example, after the patient mentioned bleeding gums, the student immediately asked, 'Are you feeling any pain with that bleeding?' and continued with a series of focused questions. Additionally, the student introduced new topics such as the patient's pregnancy and medical history without allowing the patient to elaborate on her initial concern. This approach is evident when the student says, 'Now it says in your chart here that you're pregnant?' and 'Do you have any significant medical problems right now?' These interruptions and the structured Q&A format indicate a score of 2, as the student did not facilitate a conversational flow that would allow the patient to fully express her narrative."
TIMELINE,4,"The medical student did a commendable job in establishing a timeline for the chief complaint and the history of the present illness. The patient mentioned that the gum bleeding had been occurring for 'a couple of weeks,' which the student confirmed. The student also identified that the bleeding and soreness primarily occurred during tooth brushing and occasionally during the day. However, there were minor gaps in the chronology of associated symptoms. For instance, the student did not delve into whether the symptoms had worsened, improved, or remained consistent over the couple of weeks. Additionally, while the student explored the patient's dental history and previous treatments, they did not establish a clear timeline for the onset of the current symptoms in relation to the patient's pregnancy. Overall, the student gathered most of the necessary information but missed some details that could have provided a more comprehensive timeline."
ORGANIZATION,4,"The medical student demonstrated a mostly logical and organized approach throughout the interview. The conversation began with a clear introduction and an open-ended question about the patient's reason for the visit, which is a good practice. The student then followed up with relevant questions about the symptoms, duration, and context of the bleeding gums, as well as the patient's pregnancy status, which is pertinent to the condition discussed. For example, the student asked, 'How long is this bleeding, gums? How long have they been going on?' and 'Are you feeling any pain with that bleeding?'. These questions were logical and flowed well from one to the next. The student also provided a clear explanation of the potential link between pregnancy and gingivitis, which was well-received by the patient. However, there were a few minor deviations and some sections that felt slightly extended, such as the detailed discussion about cultural practices and the patient's concerns about anesthesia. While these were important topics, they could have been more succinctly addressed to maintain a tighter flow. For instance, the conversation about cultural practices and the use of girdles to prevent the fetus from getting too large was somewhat tangential: 'But what I'm doing now is I put on some girdles, two kind of band-aid thing, to tighten up my belly to prevent my fetus getting fatter.' Overall, the interview was well-organized, but the flow was not as seamless as it could have been, which is why it merits a score of 4."
TRANSITIONAL STATEMENTS,Not scored,Not in mapping_items_to_score
QUESTIONING SKILLS TYPES OF QUESTIONS,3,"The medical student demonstrated a mix of open-ended and specific questions throughout the interview. The initial question, 'What brings you into the dental clinic today?' is a good open-ended question. However, the student frequently used specific or direct questions to gather information, such as 'Are you feeling any pain with that bleeding?' and 'How far along are you?' These are appropriate but not open-ended. The student also used some leading questions, such as 'Nothing you know of? No history of diabetes, high blood pressure, cancer, anything like that?' and 'You do not at all? Okay. You haven't used any illicit drugs such as marijuana or cocaine?' which could influence the patient's responses. There were no 'why' questions or multiple questions, which is positive. Overall, the student often failed to begin a line of inquiry with open-ended questions but did not excessively use poor question types."
QUESTIONING SKILLS SUMMARIZING,1,"The medical student did not summarize the data obtained at any point during the interview. The conversation flowed continuously without any clear summarization of the patient's history, symptoms, or concerns. For example, after discussing the patient's gum bleeding and its potential link to pregnancy, the student did not summarize this information to ensure clarity. Similarly, after discussing the patient's oral hygiene habits and cultural practices, there was no summarization to confirm understanding. The student also missed opportunities to summarize after discussing the treatment plan and the potential need for deep cleaning. The lack of summarization could lead to misunderstandings or missed information, which is critical in a medical setting."
QUESTIONING SKILLS DUPLICATION,Not scored,Not in mapping_items_to_score
QUESTIONING SKILLS LACK OF JARGON,4,"The medical student generally used language that was easily understood by the patient and avoided excessive medical jargon. For example, the student explained terms like 'gingivitis' and 'plaque' in simple terms: 'Sometimes the body's response against the bacteria with the hormones can be inflammation and can cause gingivitis.' However, there were instances where the student used terms like 'periodontal exam' and 'quadrants' without immediate explanation, which could be confusing for a patient without medical knowledge. The student did a good job of explaining the relationship between pregnancy and gum disease, but there were moments where the explanations could have been simplified further or clarified sooner. Overall, the language used was mostly appropriate to the patient's level of education, with minor lapses."
QUESTIONING SKILLS VERIFICATION OF PATIENT INFORMATION,4,"The medical student frequently seeks clarification, verification, and specificity of the patient's responses, demonstrating a clear pattern of following up on important details. For example, when the patient mentions she is about 20 weeks pregnant, the student verifies by repeating, 'About 20 weeks?' Similarly, when discussing the duration of gum bleeding, the student confirms, 'A couple of weeks?' The student also clarifies the patient's brushing and flossing habits and verifies the patient's medical history and medication use. However, there are a few minor missed opportunities for further clarification. For instance, when the patient mentions using girdles to prevent the fetus from getting fatter, the student does not delve deeper into understanding the potential implications or safety of this practice. Overall, the student demonstrates a strong ability to seek clarification and verification, with only minor gaps that do not significantly impact the overall understanding of the patient's situation."
VERBAL FACILITATION SKILLS,3,"The medical student demonstrated some facilitative skills but did not consistently use them throughout the interview. The student asked open-ended questions and provided explanations, but there were missed opportunities for verbal encouragement and echoing. For example, the student did not acknowledge the patient's concerns about anesthesia affecting the baby with empathetic statements. Instead, the student provided factual information without much emotional support: 'I can completely understand that you don't want to put chemicals in your body with your belief system and whatnot during the pregnancy.' Additionally, the student did not use short statements or echoing to encourage the patient to elaborate on her feelings and concerns. The conversation was more focused on providing information rather than facilitating a two-way dialogue. Therefore, the student's performance aligns with a score of 3, as there was some use of facilitative skills but not consistently or effectively."
EMPATHY AND ACKNOWLEDGING PATIENT CUES,2,"The medical student demonstrates limited attempts at empathy, but these are infrequent and sometimes poorly executed. The student provides thorough explanations and addresses the patient's concerns, but there are missed opportunities to connect emotionally and show deeper empathy. For example, when the patient expresses concern about the safety of anesthesia for her baby, the student responds with factual information but does not acknowledge the patient's anxiety or offer reassurance in a supportive manner. The student says, 'I can completely understand that you don't want to put chemicals in your body with your belief system and whatnot during the pregnancy,' which shows some understanding but lacks warmth and emotional connection. Additionally, the student does not use NURS techniques or equivalent methods to demonstrate empathy consistently. Overall, the student's approach is somewhat detached and focused more on providing information than on addressing the patient's emotional needs."
PATIENTS PERSPECTIVE & BELIEFS,4,"The medical student made a clear effort to elicit the patient's perspectives and beliefs, covering several elements of FIFE, but not all comprehensively. The student explored the patient's ideas about the cause of her gum bleeding, explaining the link between pregnancy and gingivitis. The student also asked about the patient's cultural practices and beliefs related to pregnancy, such as the use of Chinese tea and girdles to manage the baby's size and the mother's body figure. The student addressed the patient's concerns about medication and anesthesia affecting her baby, showing an understanding of her expectations and fears. However, the student did not deeply explore the patient's feelings about her illness or the impact on her daily function. For example, the student did not ask how the gum bleeding affects her daily life or emotional well-being. Direct quotes supporting this evaluation include: 'What is generally done during the pregnancy in terms of beliefs that are thought to be good for the baby, to keep the baby healthy?' and 'Do you have any concerns about stressing the baby while you're in the chair?' These questions show an attempt to understand the patient's perspective, but a more comprehensive exploration of all FIFE elements would have warranted a score of 5."
IMPACT OF ILLNESS ON PATIENT AND PATIENT_S SELF-IMAGE,Not scored,Not in mapping_items_to_score
SUPPORT SYSTEMS,3,"The medical student made some attempts to explore the patient's support systems but did not cover all necessary aspects comprehensively. The student asked about the patient's living situation and who she consults for health decisions: 'Generally, who do you consult with for your health decisions? Do you have someone, like, are you married? Do you have any family members other than your husband?' and 'I live with my husband and parents-in-law.' This shows an attempt to understand the patient's emotional support. However, the student did not explore financial support or other resources available to the patient. There was no discussion about the patient's access to healthcare or any community resources that might be available to her. Therefore, the student determined some of the available support but did not provide a comprehensive exploration."
PATIENTS EDUCATION AND UNDERSTANDING,5,"The medical student demonstrated a thorough approach to ensuring the patient's understanding and addressing her concerns. The student used several deliberate techniques to check the patient's comprehension, such as asking her to repeat information ('So do you understand everything that I'm telling you about? Could you just tell me what you think that I'm telling you, just so we're both on the same page?'). The student also addressed the patient's concerns about anesthesia and its effects on the fetus by providing scientific evidence and reassurance ('Yes, we have a lot of scientific evidence that anesthetic is safe...'). Additionally, the student explored the patient's cultural practices and beliefs, which could impact her health decisions ('And this tea, is it commonly done in your culture, in your Korean, correct?'). The student also made sure to ask if the patient had any other questions or concerns multiple times throughout the interview ('Do you have any other concerns or problems with the treatment that we're going to be giving?' and 'Do you have any other questions for me today?'). Overall, the student effectively ensured the patient's understanding and provided appropriate education tailored to her needs."
ASSESS MOTIVATION FOR CHANGES,Not scored,Not in mapping_items_to_score
ACHIEVE A SHARED PLAN,Not scored,Not in mapping_items_to_score
ENCOURAGEMENT OF QUESTIONS,4,"The medical student did a commendable job of encouraging the patient to ask questions and discuss additional points throughout the interview. For instance, the student responded to the patient's request for a slower explanation about the correlation between pregnancy and gingivitis: 'Sure. No problem. When you're pregnant, your body is producing hormones such as estrogen and progesterone in high levels.' The student also addressed the patient's concerns about anesthesia and its effects on the fetus: 'Sure. When we give you the anesthesia, we will keep it just in the area of your mouth that we're working on, and we'll try to give you as little as possible to make it effective.' Additionally, the student asked, 'Do you have any other concerns or problems with the treatment that we're going to be giving?' and 'Do you have any other questions for me today?' These instances show a clear attempt to be open to patient input. However, the student did not consistently encourage questions at the end of every major subsection, which is why the score is not a perfect 5."
CLOSURE,5,"The medical student clearly specifies the future plans at the end of the interview. The student outlines what they will do next ('we're going to do a complete periodontal exam on you'), what the patient will do ('you need to come in for...one visit for a general cleaning...and then one visit for each quadrant that we decide you need a deep cleaning on'), and provides a clear timeline ('the most amount of visits that we're looking at is five...the least amount is one...we'll be able to tell you that at the end of today's visit'). This comprehensive closure ensures the patient knows exactly what to expect moving forward."
NEGOTIATES PRIORITIES & SETS AGENDA,1,"The medical student did not negotiate priorities or set an agenda for the visit. The student focused solely on the chief complaint of gum bleeding and did not explore any other potential concerns the patient might have had. The conversation was driven by the physician's questions and explanations, without any effort to list or prioritize the patient's concerns. For example, the physician started with, 'What brings you into the dental clinic today?' and then immediately delved into the details of the gum bleeding without asking if there were any other issues the patient wanted to discuss. The student also did not seek the patient's agreement on the agenda for the visit. The entire interaction was centered around the physician's need to address the gum bleeding and provide information about its connection to pregnancy, without considering a broader spectrum of patient concerns."

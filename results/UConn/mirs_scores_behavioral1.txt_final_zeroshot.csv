OPENING,5,"The medical student, Amy, successfully includes all key elements in the opening of the interview. She introduces herself ('Hi. My name is Amy.'), clarifies her role ('I'm a second-year medical student.'), inquires how to address the patient ('Mr. Smitherson, is that correct?'), and uses the patient's name ('Okay. How old are you, Tom?'). Therefore, based on the criteria, the student deserves a score of 5."
ELICITING THE NARRATIVE THREAD or the PATIENT_S STORY,2,"The medical student primarily conducted the interview in a Q&A style, which limited the patient's ability to freely narrate their story. The student frequently interrupted the patient with specific questions, which directed the conversation rather than allowing the patient to lead. For example, after the patient mentioned taking vitamin D for mood improvement, the student immediately asked, 'Is there a particular reason?' instead of allowing the patient to elaborate on their own. Additionally, the student often introduced new topics without fully exploring the patient's responses, such as moving quickly from the patient's father's lung cancer diagnosis to asking about other medications. This approach hindered the development of a more natural, patient-led narrative."

ORGANIZATION,5,"The medical student, Amy, demonstrated excellent organization throughout the interview. She began by introducing herself and confirming the patient's name, then clearly outlined the structure of the interview: 'So I'll start off by asking you questions about your current medical history, and then your past medical history, family history, social history. Get to know what you know about smoking and its effects on your body, and then we'll go through a plan.' This set clear expectations for the patient. Amy followed this structure closely, moving logically from current health status to past medical history, family history, and social history. She then transitioned smoothly into discussing the patient's smoking habits and motivations for quitting, before finally developing a detailed quit plan. Amy also effectively managed time, ensuring all necessary topics were covered without rushing or prolonging any section unduly. Her questions were coherent and followed a logical progression, making it easy for the patient to follow along. For example, after discussing the patient's smoking habits, she naturally moved to the patient's knowledge about smoking and its effects, and then to triggers and patterns of smoking. The interview concluded with a clear summary and a plan, ensuring the patient understood the next steps. Overall, Amy's performance aligns perfectly with the criteria for a score of 5."

QUESTIONING SKILLS TYPES OF QUESTIONS,3,"The medical student demonstrated a mix of open-ended and specific questions throughout the interview. The student began the conversation with an open-ended question about the patient's reason for the visit: 'I understand you've come in today because you're interested in quitting smoking. Is that correct?' However, many subsequent questions were more specific or direct, such as 'How old are you, Tom?' and 'Are there any illnesses or medical conditions that you are currently experiencing?' The student did use some open-ended questions to explore the patient's smoking habits and motivations, such as 'Have you ever considered quitting in the past, or did you ever quit in the past?' and 'What makes you think it's going to work this time around?' However, there were also instances of leading questions, such as 'So kind of like peer pressure and kind of influence?' and 'So what makes you think it's going to work this time around?' Additionally, the student asked multiple questions in a single turn, such as 'Do you have any history of, besides the smoking, do you have any history of alcohol use or recreational drug use?' Overall, the student often failed to begin lines of inquiry with open-ended questions and used a few leading and multiple questions, which aligns with a score of 3."
QUESTIONING SKILLS SUMMARIZING,5,"The medical student consistently summarized the data obtained at the end of each major line of inquiry, ensuring clarity and accuracy. For example, after discussing the patient's current health status and smoking habits, the student summarized: 'So you mentioned that you're taking vitamin D, and it's mostly to just help you with your mood. Is that correct?' This was confirmed by the patient. Additionally, at the end of the interview, the student provided a comprehensive summary of the plan: 'So from everything that we've discussed, I just want to make sure that I've said things clearly and that I haven't misspoke. Would you be able to repeat back the plan that we've come up with?' The patient then accurately repeated the plan, indicating that the student had effectively communicated and summarized the information. The student also summarized the patient's social history and family history accurately, ensuring no details were missed. Overall, the student demonstrated excellent summarization skills throughout the interview."
QUESTIONING SKILLS DUPLICATION,Not scored,Not in mapping_items_to_score
QUESTIONING SKILLS LACK OF JARGON,5,"The medical student consistently used language that was easily understood by the patient and avoided medical jargon throughout the interview. For example, the student explained the purpose of vitamin D in simple terms: 'So you are taking the vitamin D to improve your mood.' When discussing the effects of smoking, the student used clear language: 'Smoking can increase your risk of developing lung disease and lung cancer. It can also contribute to heart disease as well.' Additionally, the student provided straightforward explanations for treatment options, such as describing how Chantix works: 'What it does is it actually binds to the places where nicotine would bind in your brain, and it prevents nicotine from binding.' The student also ensured that the patient understood the plan by asking them to repeat it back and addressing any concerns in a clear and empathetic manner. Overall, the student demonstrated excellent communication skills by using language appropriate to the patient's level of education and avoiding medical jargon."
QUESTIONING SKILLS VERIFICATION OF PATIENT INFORMATION,Not scored,Not in mapping_items_to_score
VERBAL FACILITATION SKILLS,4,"The medical student demonstrated frequent use of facilitation skills throughout the interview, but there were a few missed opportunities for more effective engagement. The student used verbal encouragement and short statements to keep the conversation flowing, such as 'Okay,' 'Right,' and 'Good.' The student also echoed the patient's statements to show understanding, for example, 'So it's probably been tough on you in terms of your father's health history and also school.' However, there were moments where the student could have provided more specific verbal encouragement or explored the patient's feelings further. For instance, when the patient mentioned feeling low due to their father's lung cancer diagnosis, the student quickly moved on without delving deeper into the emotional impact. Overall, the student showed a good level of facilitation but could improve by being more consistent and timely with their verbal encouragement and exploration of the patient's emotions."
EMPATHY AND ACKNOWLEDGING PATIENT CUES,4,"The medical student, Amy, demonstrates a good level of empathy and acknowledges patient cues throughout the interview. She uses supportive comments and shows understanding of the patient's situation, particularly when discussing the patient's father's lung cancer diagnosis and the patient's struggles with quitting smoking. For example, she says, 'Sorry to hear about that,' and 'I'm sure it has been difficult on you and your family.' She also acknowledges the patient's concerns about financial constraints and offers practical solutions, such as discussing the Pfizer program for medication. However, there are moments where deeper empathy could have been shown, such as when the patient mentions feeling low in spirits or flunking out of college. While Amy does express some understanding, these moments could have been opportunities for more profound empathetic engagement. Overall, Amy's performance is strong, but there are occasional missed opportunities for deeper connection, which is why the score is a 4."
PATIENTS PERSPECTIVE & BELIEFS,3,"The medical student made some attempts to elicit the patient's perspective on their illness and beliefs, but did not fully explore all aspects of FIFE (Feelings, Ideas, Function, Expectations). The student did inquire about the patient's reasons for wanting to quit smoking, such as the father's lung cancer diagnosis and the patient's own health concerns. However, the student did not delve deeply into the patient's feelings about their smoking habit or the emotional impact of their father's illness. The student also did not explore the patient's expectations for treatment and outcomes in detail. For example, the student asked, 'So what makes you think it's going to work this time around?' but did not follow up with questions about the patient's specific expectations or hopes for the future. Additionally, while the student discussed the patient's social support and living situation, they did not fully explore how the smoking habit affects the patient's daily function or quality of life. Overall, the student showed some awareness of the importance of the patient's viewpoint but did not effectively draw out or address these beliefs and practices comprehensively."
IMPACT OF ILLNESS ON PATIENT AND PATIENT_S SELF-IMAGE,Not scored,Not in mapping_items_to_score
SUPPORT SYSTEMS,5,"The medical student, Amy, thoroughly explored the patient's support systems across multiple dimensions. She inquired about emotional support by asking, 'So who really serves as your social support? Would you say it's your parents, or do you have friends in the area?' The patient responded that his parents are his main support system. Amy also addressed financial support by asking, 'Do you have insurance through your job?' and later discussing financial assistance programs for medication: 'Pfizer actually has a program where they can actually sponsor the prescription for you.' Additionally, she suggested community resources and strategies to help the patient quit smoking, such as using a calendar and contract, and involving his parents in his quit plan: 'So it's a really good idea to get their support in your efforts. So tell them that you're going to quit smoking, and I'm sure they'll support you considering they themselves quit smoking.' This comprehensive approach meets the criteria for a score of 5."
PATIENTS EDUCATION AND UNDERSTANDING,5,"The medical student, Amy, demonstrated a comprehensive approach to ensuring the patient's understanding and addressing patient education throughout the interview. She used several deliberate techniques to check the patient's understanding, such as asking the patient to repeat back the plan (e.g., 'Would you be able to repeat back the plan that we've come up with?'). Amy also asked if the patient had any questions multiple times (e.g., 'Do you have any questions at this time or any other concerns you've thought of?'). She provided detailed explanations about the effects of smoking, the medication Chantix, and strategies for quitting smoking, ensuring the patient was well-informed. Additionally, Amy assessed the patient's level of interest in education and tailored her information accordingly, such as discussing the patient's knowledge of smoking's effects and providing additional details where necessary. Overall, Amy's approach was thorough, patient-centered, and effective in ensuring the patient's understanding and engagement in their care plan."
ASSESS MOTIVATION FOR CHANGES,5,"The medical student did an excellent job of assessing the patient's motivation for change and offering a comprehensive plan to support the patient's efforts to quit smoking. The student inquired about the patient's feelings and motivations multiple times, such as when asking, 'So what makes you think it's going to work this time around?' and 'Do those sound like things that you'd be interested in doing?' The student also provided a range of options and plans, including setting a quit date, removing smoking-related items, using medication (Chantix), involving social support, and using a calendar and contract to track progress. The student even addressed potential concerns like weight gain and financial constraints, ensuring a holistic approach to the patient's needs. Overall, the student demonstrated a thorough understanding of the importance of patient buy-in and provided robust support for the patient's behavioral change."
ACHIEVE A SHARED PLAN,5,"The medical student, Amy, thoroughly discusses the diagnosis and prognosis of smoking with Tom and actively involves him in creating a shared plan to quit smoking. Amy invites Tom to contribute his thoughts and preferences multiple times throughout the conversation. For example, she asks, 'Do you have anything in mind in particular?' when discussing a quit date and 'Does that sound like something you would be able to do?' when suggesting removing smoking-related items from his environment. Amy also addresses Tom's financial concerns by suggesting the Pfizer program for Chantix and reassures him about the process. She ensures Tom understands the plan by asking him to repeat it back and addresses his concerns about weight gain and the possibility of the treatment not working. This comprehensive and collaborative approach justifies a score of 5."
ENCOURAGEMENT OF QUESTIONS,5,"The medical student consistently encouraged the patient to ask questions and bring up additional topics throughout the interview. For example, early in the conversation, the student said, 'If anything comes up, you can just stop me or just remember for later. Sound good?' This set a tone of openness from the beginning. The student also asked, 'Do you have any questions at this time or any other concerns you've thought of?' and 'Do you have any questions or any other concerns?' multiple times throughout the interview. Additionally, the student provided opportunities for the patient to discuss additional points, such as when they asked, 'So besides your concern about quitting smoking, do you have any other things that you would like to speak about today?' The student also revisited the patient's concerns about the cost of medication and the effectiveness of the treatment, ensuring that the patient felt heard and supported. Overall, the student demonstrated a proactive approach to encouraging patient questions and input, which aligns with the criteria for a score of 5."
CLOSURE,5,"The medical student provided a comprehensive and clear plan for the future, covering all three critical areas: student actions, patient actions, and timing. The student specified that they would discuss the plan with Dr. Lelko and handle the paperwork for the Pfizer program to get the medication (student actions). The patient was given clear instructions on what to do, including picking a quit date, removing smoking-related items, informing family and friends, and using a calendar and contract for motivation (patient actions). The timing was also clearly specified, with a quit date set for two weeks from today and a follow-up visit scheduled in about three weeks. The student also reassured the patient about the support available and addressed additional concerns about weight gain and the effectiveness of the medication. Direct quotes supporting this include: 'So from everything that we've discussed, I just want to make sure that I've said things clearly and that I haven't misspoke. Would you be able to repeat back the plan that we've come up with?' and 'So we'll schedule a follow-up visit with Dr. Lelko when she comes in. So we look forward to seeing you in about three weeks.'"
ELICITS SPECTRUM OF CONCERNS,5,"The medical student, Amy, successfully elicited the patient's full spectrum of concerns within the first 3-5 minutes of the interview. She began by confirming the patient's chief complaint about quitting smoking and then explicitly asked, 'So besides your concern about quitting smoking, do you have any other things that you would like to speak about today?' The patient responded, 'No. That was pretty much it.' Amy further ensured that the patient could bring up any additional concerns later by saying, 'If anything comes up, you can just stop me or just remember for later.' This approach confirms that Amy was thorough in addressing the patient's concerns and left room for any additional issues to be raised."
NEGOTIATES PRIORITIES & SETS AGENDA,5,"The medical student, Amy, demonstrated a thorough and effective approach to negotiating the patient's priorities and setting the agenda for the visit. She began by confirming the patient's primary concern: 'I understand you've come in today because you're interested in quitting smoking. Is that correct?' This ensured that the main issue was identified right at the start. Amy then outlined the structure of the visit: 'So I'll start off by asking you questions about your current medical history, and then your past medical history, family history, social history. Get to know what you know about smoking and its effects on your body, and then we'll go through a plan. Does that sound like a good idea?' This clear agenda-setting was agreed upon by the patient: 'That sounds good.' Additionally, Amy asked if there were any other concerns: 'So besides your concern about quitting smoking, do you have any other things that you would like to speak about today?' The patient confirmed there were no other concerns, but Amy still left room for additional issues to be raised: 'If anything comes up, you can just stop me or just remember for later. Sound good?' Throughout the interview, Amy revisited and reinforced the plan, ensuring the patient was on board and understood each step. For example, she confirmed the patient's understanding and agreement multiple times: 'Does that sound like something you would be able to do?' and 'Does that sound like a good idea?' This consistent engagement and confirmation of the patient's agreement to the agenda and plan demonstrate a high level of negotiation and patient-centered care, justifying a score of 5."

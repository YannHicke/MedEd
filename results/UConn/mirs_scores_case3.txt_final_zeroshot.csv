OPENING,5,"The medical student, Brianna, successfully includes all key elements in the opening of the interview. She introduces herself ('Hi, I'm Brianna'), clarifies her role ('I'm a medical student'), inquires how to address the patient ('Is that how you'd like to be addressed today?'), and uses the patient's name ('Nice to meet you, Dan'). Therefore, based on the criteria, the student deserves a score of 5."
ELICITING THE NARRATIVE THREAD or the PATIENT_S STORY,2,"The medical student primarily conducted the interview in a Q&A style, which limited the patient's ability to freely narrate their story. While the student did ask open-ended questions initially, such as 'tell me a little bit about what brought you to the office today,' the conversation quickly shifted to a series of focused questions. For example, the student asked, 'What makes it sharp?' and 'Is there anything that makes the pain better?' These questions, while relevant, interrupted the patient's narrative flow. Additionally, the student frequently introduced new information and redirected the conversation, as seen when they asked about the dosage of Advil and the patient's past medical history. This approach did not allow the patient to fully elaborate on their concerns without interruption. Therefore, the student's performance aligns more closely with a score of 2."
TIMELINE,5,"The medical student, Brianna, successfully establishes a comprehensive timeline of the patient's chief complaint and history of the present illness. She identifies that the chest pain started two nights ago and is associated with a mountain biking incident where the patient fell and hit his chest. The student also clarifies that the pain is sometimes aching and sometimes sharp, worsened by lifting and alleviated by Advil and rest. She confirms that the pain has not changed in intensity over the past two days. Additionally, Brianna ensures there are no other associated symptoms like coughing or shortness of breath. The chronology of the symptoms and the context of the incident are well-documented, allowing for a clear understanding of the patient's condition. Direct quotes supporting this include: 'It started about two nights ago,' 'It's made worse if you're lifting things,' 'It's made better by Advil,' and 'I fell off towards the end, hit a bump that I didn't quite see, hit myself on the bike as I fell.'"
ORGANIZATION,5,"The medical student, Brianna, conducted the interview in a highly organized and logical manner. She began with introductions and consent, then moved systematically through the patient's presenting complaint, history of present illness, past medical history, family history, social history, and finally, a summary and plan. Each section flowed naturally into the next, and she used summarization effectively to ensure understanding and accuracy. For example, after discussing the patient's chest pain, she summarized: 'So it sounds like you've had chest pain for two days now... Does that sound about right?' This approach ensured that the patient and physician were on the same page. Additionally, Brianna managed time effectively, covering all necessary aspects without rushing or prolonging any section unnecessarily. The interview was comprehensive and well-structured, demonstrating excellent organizational skills."

QUESTIONING SKILLS TYPES OF QUESTIONS,4,"The medical student, Brianna, begins the information gathering with an open-ended question: 'All right, so tell me a little bit about what brought you to the office today.' This is a strong start and sets the tone for the interview. Throughout the interview, Brianna mostly uses open-ended questions to gather information, such as 'Can you tell me a little bit about that?' and 'Do you lift on a regular basis or did you notice it somehow?' However, there are instances where she uses more specific or direct questions to begin new lines of inquiry, such as 'Do you have any other symptoms besides the pain in your chest?' and 'Have you ever had surgery before?' These are appropriate follow-up questions but could have been initiated with more open-ended questions. There are very few poor question types used, with no leading, why, or multiple questions evident. Overall, Brianna's questioning skills are strong, but there is room for improvement in consistently starting new lines of inquiry with open-ended questions."
QUESTIONING SKILLS SUMMARIZING,5,"The medical student consistently summarizes the data obtained at the end of each major line of inquiry, ensuring that the information is verified and clarified with the patient. For example, after discussing the patient's chest pain, the student summarizes: 'So it sounds like you've had chest pain for two days now. Sometimes it's an ache, sometimes it's sharp. It's made worse if you're lifting things and you're worried because at work you lift boxes. It's made better by Advil. You said you've taken like two in the morning, two in the afternoon. That seems to help. You're not sure what the dose is on that. And it doesn't radiate anywhere. You have no other symptoms with that. Does that sound about right?' The patient confirms this summary. Similarly, after discussing the patient's past medical history, the student summarizes: 'So just to summarize your past medical history, it sounds like you're pretty healthy. You just have seasonal allergies in the fall. And you said you take Flonase for that? ... And you haven't been hospitalized or anything like that. And your mom has diabetes for which she uses insulin. ... And she's had surgery on her heart valves in the past.' The student also summarizes the social history and the events surrounding the chest pain: 'So it sounds like you, we already talked about your job and you lift boxes at work and your free time you like to mountain bike and you do drink about a six pack of beer on the weekends and you have been drinking and mountain biking at the same time. And this past weekend you were mountain biking when your chest pain started because you fell off your mountain bike.' These summaries are accurate and comprehensive, demonstrating the student's effective summarization skills."
QUESTIONING SKILLS DUPLICATION,4,"The medical student, Brianna, generally avoids repeating questions unnecessarily and maintains a good flow throughout the interview. However, there are a few instances where she repeats questions or information that the patient has already provided. For example, after the patient mentions that lifting makes the pain worse, Brianna asks again, 'Okay, and you said lifting makes it worse.' Additionally, she repeats the information about the patient's work and lifting boxes multiple times: 'Okay, and you lift boxes at work?' and 'So it sounds like you, we already talked about your job and you lift boxes at work.' These repetitions are not for clarification or summarization but seem to stem from a need to confirm information. Despite these minor repetitions, the overall flow of the interview is not significantly disrupted, and Brianna effectively summarizes the patient's information at various points. Therefore, a score of 4 is appropriate."
QUESTIONING SKILLS LACK OF JARGON,5,"The medical student consistently used language that was easily understood by the patient and avoided medical jargon throughout the interview. For example, instead of using terms like 'myocardial infarction' or 'angina,' the student referred to the patient's concern as 'heart pain.' When discussing medications, the student used the brand name 'Advil' rather than the generic name 'ibuprofen,' which is more commonly recognized by patients. Additionally, the student asked about 'lifting boxes' and 'mountain biking' in straightforward terms, ensuring the patient could easily follow the conversation. The student also summarized the patient's history and symptoms in simple language, confirming understanding with the patient. Overall, the language used was appropriate to the patient's level of education, and there were no instances of unexplained medical jargon."
QUESTIONING SKILLS VERIFICATION OF PATIENT INFORMATION,4,"The medical student frequently seeks clarification, verification, and specificity of the patient's responses, demonstrating a clear pattern of following up on important details. For example, the student asks about the nature of the pain ('Can you tell me a little bit about that?'), what makes it worse ('What makes it sharp?'), and what makes it better ('Is there anything that makes the pain better?'). The student also verifies the dosage of Advil ('Do you know what the dose is of the Advil?') and the patient's medical history ('Do you take any medicines on a daily basis?'). Additionally, the student clarifies the patient's social history and activities ('Have you been mountain biking recently?'). However, there are a few minor missed opportunities for further clarification, such as not asking more about the specific location of the chest pain or the exact nature of the fall during mountain biking. These minor gaps do not significantly impact the overall understanding of the patient's situation, but they prevent the score from being a perfect 5."
VERBAL FACILITATION SKILLS,4,"The medical student frequently uses facilitation skills during the interview, but not as consistently or effectively as in a score of 5. The student provides verbal encouragement and uses short statements to keep the conversation going. For example, the student says, 'Oh, I'm really sorry to hear about that. Can you tell me a little bit about that?' and 'Okay, and is there anything that makes the pain better?' These statements help to encourage the patient to provide more information. The student also uses echoing effectively, such as when summarizing the patient's symptoms: 'So it sounds like you've had chest pain for two days now. Sometimes it's an ache, sometimes it's sharp.' However, there are a few missed opportunities for more specific verbal encouragement or deeper exploration of the patient's feelings and concerns. For instance, when the patient expresses worry about returning to work, the student could have provided more empathetic responses or reassurance. Overall, the student demonstrates good facilitation skills but could improve in consistency and depth."
EMPATHY AND ACKNOWLEDGING PATIENT CUES,3,"The medical student, Brianna, demonstrates a neutral level of empathy throughout the interview. She acknowledges the patient's concerns and provides a thorough history-taking, but there are limited explicit expressions of empathy or emotional support. For example, when the patient mentions being worried about his heart, Brianna responds with 'Oh, I'm really sorry to hear about that,' which is a basic acknowledgment but lacks depth. She does not employ NURS techniques or delve deeper into the patient's emotional state. Additionally, when the patient expresses worry about returning to work, Brianna responds with 'Okay, well, that's understandable,' which is a neutral acknowledgment but does not offer much emotional support. Overall, Brianna's approach is professional and thorough but lacks the deeper empathetic connection that would warrant a higher score."

IMPACT OF ILLNESS ON PATIENT AND PATIENT_S SELF-IMAGE,2,"The medical student, Brianna, makes limited attempts to address the impact of the illness on Dan's life or self-image. While she does inquire about his work and living situation, she does not delve deeply into how the chest pain is affecting his emotional state or self-perception. For example, she acknowledges his concern about returning to work but does not explore his feelings about this worry or offer any counseling or resources to help him cope. The conversation is more focused on gathering medical history and symptoms rather than exploring the broader impact of the illness. Quotes to support this include: 'I'm worried if that's gonna interfere with that or if it's my heart, it might make it worse.' and 'Okay, well, that's understandable.' These show some awareness of the patient's concerns but lack depth in addressing them."
SUPPORT SYSTEMS,4,"The medical student, Brianna, does a commendable job in exploring the patient's support systems, though not comprehensively enough to warrant a perfect score. She addresses the emotional support by asking about the patient's living situation and relationships: 'And do you have any family or friends in the area?' and 'My girlfriend lives in town.' She further explores the patient's reliance on his girlfriend: 'So do you think that you could look to your girlfriend in a time of need for her to help you out if you were sick or anything like that?' This shows an understanding of the patient's emotional support system. However, the student does not delve into the patient's financial support or healthcare access, which are crucial aspects of a comprehensive evaluation. The student does touch on the patient's work situation and potential need for a doctor's note: 'Do you think your boss would be okay with you taking some time off if you needed to?' but does not explore other financial or community resources. Therefore, the student covers two of the three main areas (emotional and some aspects of other resources) but misses out on financial support, leading to a score of 4."

ENCOURAGEMENT OF QUESTIONS,1,"The medical student did not provide the patient with any explicit opportunities to ask questions or discuss additional points throughout the interview. The student moved from one question to the next without pausing to check if the patient had any questions or additional concerns. For example, after summarizing the patient's symptoms and history, the student immediately transitioned to the next topic without asking if the patient had any questions or additional information to provide: 'So just to summarize your past medical history, it sounds like you're pretty healthy... And your mom has diabetes for which she uses insulin.' There was no point in the conversation where the student explicitly encouraged the patient to ask questions or bring up additional topics, which is why the score is a 1."
CLOSURE,2,"The medical student makes limited attempts to specify future plans at the end of the interview. The student mentions, 'I will talk with my doctor and you can wait here. I'll be back in a few minutes,' which indicates some awareness of the need for closure. However, the information provided is vague and incomplete, leaving the patient with an unclear sense of what to expect next. The student does not specify what actions the patient should take, nor does she provide a clear timeline for the next steps beyond 'a few minutes.' There is no mention of any follow-up appointments or further instructions for the patient."
ELICITS SPECTRUM OF CONCERNS,4,"The medical student, Brianna, did a thorough job of eliciting the patient's chief complaint and secondary concerns within the first 3-5 minutes of the interview. She asked about the nature of the chest pain, what exacerbates and alleviates it, and the patient's concerns about it being heart-related. She also inquired about the patient's work and how the pain might affect it. However, Brianna did not ask a final 'Anything else?' question or an equivalent to ensure all concerns were raised. For example, she could have asked, 'Is there anything else you are worried about?' to make sure no concerns were missed. Therefore, the score is a 4."
NEGOTIATES PRIORITIES & SETS AGENDA,1,"The medical student did not negotiate the priorities or set an agenda for the visit. The student focused primarily on the chief complaint of chest pain and did not explore other potential concerns or priorities the patient might have had. The student did not explicitly list all of the patient's concerns or set an agenda at the onset of the interview. For example, the student began with, 'So I'd like to just talk with you for a little bit before the doctor comes in about what brings you in. Is that okay?' but did not follow up with a comprehensive agenda-setting or prioritization of issues. The conversation was driven by the physician's questions rather than a negotiated agenda with the patient."

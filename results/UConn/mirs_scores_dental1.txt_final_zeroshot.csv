OPENING,4,"The medical student introduces herself: 'I'm Kylie Haynes.' She clarifies her role: 'I'm going to be taking a look today.' She uses the patient's name: 'Hi, Ms. Austin.' However, she does not explicitly inquire how the patient prefers to be addressed. Therefore, the introduction is missing one element, leading to a score of 4."
ELICITING THE NARRATIVE THREAD or the PATIENT_S STORY,2,"The medical student primarily conducted the interview in a Q&A style, which limited the patient's ability to freely narrate their story. The student frequently interrupted the patient with specific questions, which directed the conversation rather than allowing the patient to elaborate on their own. For example, after the patient mentioned, 'Well, I have a lot of soreness right here. I think it's abscessed. I'm not really sure,' the student immediately followed up with, 'It's very painful. On both sides?' This pattern continued throughout the interview, as seen when the patient started to explain their medical history related to chemical sensitivities, and the student interjected with, 'Okay. And why do you have it?' Additionally, the student introduced new information and redirected the conversation multiple times, such as when discussing the patient's dental history and the materials used for fillings. Overall, the student did not provide ample space for the patient to narrate their story without frequent interruptions and redirections."
TIMELINE,4,"The medical student, Kylie Haynes, obtained most of the information necessary to establish a chronology of the chief complaint and history of the present illness. The patient reported a throbbing pain in her lower teeth that has been persistent for about 10 days. The student confirmed this timeline multiple times: 'It's been about 10 days?' and 'And it's been about 10 days, but you had some mercury fillings, some probably amalgam, are they silver-colored?' The student also explored the patient's dental history, including the removal of mercury fillings two years ago and other dental work like wisdom teeth removal 15 years ago. However, there were minor gaps in the timeline of associated symptoms. For instance, while the student asked about the duration and nature of the pain, they did not delve deeply into whether the pain had any specific triggers or if it varied in intensity over the 10 days. Additionally, the student did not explore the onset and progression of other symptoms like the patient's chemical sensitivities in relation to her dental issues. Therefore, while the student gathered substantial information, minor gaps in the chronology of associated symptoms prevent a perfect score."
ORGANIZATION,4,"The medical student, Kylie Haynes, conducted the interview in a mostly logical and organized manner, with only occasional minor deviations. The interview began with an introduction and a clear outline of the plan, which helped set the stage for the patient. The student then moved on to the chief complaint, asking about the pain and its characteristics, duration, and potential causes. This was followed by a discussion of the patient's past dental history and medical history, which was relevant to the patient's current condition. The student also addressed the patient's concerns about chemical sensitivities and allergies, ensuring that the patient felt understood and comfortable. However, there were a few instances where the flow of the interview could have been smoother. For example, the transition from discussing the patient's dental history to the medical history was a bit abrupt: 'So I want to ask you a few questions about medical history because it seems like from your research you've kind of gotten an idea, too, that medical and dental history will be kind of related.' Additionally, the student occasionally repeated questions or asked for clarification in a way that slightly disrupted the flow, such as when discussing the duration of the pain: 'How long is the pain, like the duration of the pain?' and 'Like how long have I had it or how long does it last?' Despite these minor issues, the overall organization and time management were effective, and the student was able to gather comprehensive information within the allowed time."
TRANSITIONAL STATEMENTS,5,"The medical student, Kylie Haynes, consistently uses transitional statements throughout the interview to explain the progression from one subsection to another. For example, at the beginning, she sets the stage by saying, 'So probably what the plan is going to be is that I'm going to ask you a few questions. They'll probably be dental-related and medical-related just so we can kind of get an idea of what's going on.' This statement clearly outlines the structure of the interview. Later, she transitions to discussing the patient's dental history by saying, 'Now, what about, I'm going to ask just a little bit more about your past dental history because I've kind of got an idea about your chief complaint right now.' This effectively signals a shift in focus while providing context. Additionally, when moving to the medical history, she states, 'So now I kind of have an idea of a little bit about your dental history. So I want to ask you a few questions about medical history because it seems like from your research you've kind of gotten an idea, too, that medical and dental history will be kind of related.' These transitions are clear, informative, and help the patient understand the flow of the interview, thereby justifying a score of 5."
QUESTIONING SKILLS TYPES OF QUESTIONS,3,"The medical student, Kylie Haynes, demonstrates a mix of open-ended and specific questions throughout the interview. She begins the information gathering with an open-ended question: 'So what brought you here today?' This is a good start. However, she often follows up with more specific or direct questions without consistently using open-ended questions to explore new lines of inquiry. For example, 'Can you describe the pain to me a little bit?' is an open-ended question, but 'How long is the pain, like the duration of the pain?' is more specific. Additionally, there are instances of multiple questions being asked together, such as 'Have you had any problems with it before this or it's just started at 10 days, 10 days ago?' and 'What kind of dental work have you had in the past? Just the wisdom teeth and a few fillings, is that about it?' These could confuse the patient. There are also leading questions like 'And did you see the dentist regularly or just when it was painful for you?' and 'So you think the problems with your teeth, you think they're related to chemical sensitivities? Is that my understanding?' which could bias the patient's responses. Overall, while there are some good open-ended questions, the frequent use of specific, multiple, and leading questions lowers the score."
QUESTIONING SKILLS SUMMARIZING,5,"The medical student consistently summarizes the data obtained at the end of each major line of inquiry, ensuring clarity and completeness. For example, after discussing the patient's chief complaint, the student summarizes: 'So just so I've got an idea, you're feeling like you have some abscesses in your mouth and they are on both sides on the lower... And it's been about 10 days, but you had some mercury fillings, some probably amalgam, are they silver-colored?' This pattern continues throughout the interview, such as when discussing the patient's medical history: 'So we have shortness of breath. We're going to try to start out with go ahead and using the oxygen while you're comfortable. You have had some chest pain that kind of comes and goes.' The student also effectively summarizes the patient's dental history and medical history before moving on to the next section, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the patient's condition. This consistent summarization demonstrates a high level of skill in verifying and clarifying information, justifying a score of 5."
QUESTIONING SKILLS DUPLICATION,2,"The medical student often repeats questions, which disrupts the flow of the interview. For example, the student asks about the duration of the pain multiple times: 'How long is the pain, like the duration of the pain?' and then 'Have you had any problems with it before this or it's just started at 10 days, 10 days ago?' Similarly, the student repeats questions about the patient's dental history: 'What kind of dental work have you had in the past? Just the wisdom teeth and a few fillings, is that about it?' and then 'So you feel like you've had dental work in the past pretty much on a regular basis. Is that correct?' Additionally, the student asks about the patient's use of baking soda twice: 'What kind of products are you using again? I know you mentioned it.' and 'Just baking soda?' These repetitions indicate a failure to remember previously provided information, leading to a disrupted interview flow."
QUESTIONING SKILLS LACK OF JARGON,4,"The medical student, Kylie Haynes, generally uses language that is easily understood by the patient and avoids excessive medical jargon. For example, she uses terms like 'throbbing pain' and 'silver-colored fillings' instead of more technical terms. However, there are instances where medical terms are used without immediate explanation, such as 'abscesses' and 'amalgam.' While the student does define 'amalgam' as 'silver-colored fillings' later, there is a slight delay. Additionally, the term 'serum' is used without explanation. Overall, the language is mostly appropriate to the patient's level of education, with minor lapses."
QUESTIONING SKILLS VERIFICATION OF PATIENT INFORMATION,4,"The medical student frequently seeks clarification, verification, and specificity of the patient's responses, demonstrating a clear pattern of following up on important details. For example, the student verifies the duration and nature of the pain ('How long is the pain, like the duration of the pain?' and 'It's been about 10 days?'). The student also clarifies the patient's dental history and the reasons for removing mercury fillings ('Why did you have the fillings removed? What do you think was the problem?'). Additionally, the student confirms the patient's allergies and medical conditions ('Are you allergic to anesthetics?' and 'Any other allergies at all that you know of?'). However, there are a few minor missed opportunities for further clarification, such as not probing deeper into the patient's chest pain and dizziness ('Chest pain. It comes and goes, so I never really know, you know, when it's going to happen.' and 'Dizziness, too. Not that often either.'). These missed opportunities are minor and do not significantly impact the overall understanding of the patient's situation, thus justifying a score of 4."
VERBAL FACILITATION SKILLS,4,"The medical student frequently used facilitation skills during the interview, but not as consistently or effectively as in a score of 5. The student used verbal encouragement, short statements, and echoing, but there were a few missed opportunities or inappropriate applications. For example, the student echoed the patient's statements multiple times, such as 'It's throbbing pain' and 'It's been about 10 days?' which shows active listening. However, there were moments where the student could have provided more specific verbal encouragement or asked more open-ended questions to further explore the patient's concerns. The student did provide some verbal encouragement, such as 'Okay' and 'All right,' but these were not always as timely or specific as in a top performance. Overall, the student demonstrated good facilitation skills but could improve on consistency and effectiveness."
EMPATHY AND ACKNOWLEDGING PATIENT CUES,3,"The medical student demonstrates a neutral level of empathy throughout the interview. The student acknowledges the patient's concerns and repeats back information to ensure understanding, such as 'It's very painful. On both sides?' and 'So you think it's just some chemical sensitivities to your teeth, and that's why you had the amalgam fillings removed then. Is that correct?'. However, the student misses several opportunities to express deeper empathy or use NURS techniques. For example, when the patient mentions the pain and the discomfort from chemical sensitivities, the student does not explicitly name the emotions or offer supportive comments. The student remains professional and attentive but does not go beyond basic acknowledgment to connect emotionally with the patient. The conversation is largely clinical and fact-finding, with limited attempts to address the patient's emotional experience."
PATIENTS PERSPECTIVE & BELIEFS,4,"The medical student, Kylie Haynes, made a clear effort to understand the patient's perspective and beliefs about her illness. She explored several elements of the FIFE model, including the patient's feelings about the illness (e.g., 'It's really painful'), ideas of its cause (e.g., 'I had some mercury fillings that I had taken out about two years ago'), and the impact on daily function (e.g., 'I don't go out that often, but when I do, I always take it with me' regarding the oxygen tank). The student also addressed the patient's expectations for treatment (e.g., 'We'll make sure that everything we do that you're comfortable with at first'). However, the student did not delve deeply into the patient's feelings and expectations as comprehensively as a score of 5 would require. For instance, while the student acknowledged the patient's chemical sensitivities and past experiences, there was limited exploration of the emotional impact and specific expectations for outcomes. Overall, the student showed a clear attempt to understand the patient's viewpoint but missed some depth in exploring all components of FIFE."
IMPACT OF ILLNESS ON PATIENT AND PATIENT_S SELF-IMAGE,Not scored,Not in mapping_items_to_score
SUPPORT SYSTEMS,4,"The medical student, Kylie Haynes, made a clear attempt to understand the patient's support systems, covering both emotional and financial aspects. She asked about the patient's living situation and family support: 'Do you live with your mom, or does she live close by?' and 'So do you have a little bit of family support then at home?' The patient responded that she lives with her mother, who is 78 and affected by diabetes, indicating some level of family support but also highlighting the mother's own health issues. The student also inquired about transportation and work status: 'What about transportation? Is transportation going to be a problem or not?' and 'Do you work at all now or no?' The patient mentioned relying on friends for transportation and being on permanent disability, which touches on financial support. However, the student did not explore other community resources or suggest appropriate community resources, which is why the score is not a 5. Overall, the student addressed most aspects of patient support but did not provide a comprehensive exploration or suggestions for additional resources."

ENCOURAGEMENT OF QUESTIONS,2,"The medical student made limited attempts to allow for patient questions or additional topics. Throughout the interview, the student did not actively encourage the patient to ask questions or bring up additional points. For example, after discussing the patient's dental history, the student did not ask if the patient had any questions or additional concerns before moving on to the medical history. Similarly, after discussing the patient's medical history, the student did not provide an opportunity for the patient to ask questions or bring up additional topics. The student did acknowledge the patient's concerns and provided some reassurance, but did not actively encourage patient input. For instance, the student said, 'We'll make sure that everything we do that you're comfortable with at first. We're not going to do, you know, anything that you're not comfortable with,' but did not follow this with an invitation for questions or further discussion. Overall, the student made some attempts to address the patient's concerns but did not consistently encourage questions or additional topics."
CLOSURE,3,"The medical student partially details the plans for the future but does not provide comprehensive closure. The student mentions that they will take a look at the patient's teeth and take x-rays ('We'll go out and get everything ready. We'll probably take a couple pictures of your teeth, x-rays. Is that all right, to take some x-rays of your teeth?'), and ensures the use of non-latex gloves ('I'll make sure we use some non-latex gloves so that won't be a problem.'). However, the student does not specify what the patient should do next or when the next communication or appointment will be. The patient is left with some understanding of immediate next steps but lacks a clear sense of the overall plan and timing."
ELICITS SPECTRUM OF CONCERNS,5,"The medical student, Kylie Haynes, effectively elicited the patient's full spectrum of concerns within the first 3-5 minutes of the interview. The student began by asking the patient what brought her in today, which led to a discussion about the patient's chief complaint of soreness and potential abscesses in her mouth. The student then asked detailed follow-up questions about the pain, its duration, and any previous dental work, which helped to uncover secondary concerns related to the patient's dental history and potential chemical sensitivities. Additionally, the student asked about the patient's medical history, including significant medical problems, allergies, and family medical history. The student also ensured to ask if there were any other significant medical problems, which is equivalent to asking 'Anything else?' to make sure all concerns were raised. This thorough approach demonstrates that the student successfully elicited the patient's full spectrum of concerns."
NEGOTIATES PRIORITIES & SETS AGENDA,3,"The medical student did set an agenda at the onset of the interview by explaining the plan to ask questions and perform an exam: 'So probably what the plan is going to be is that I'm going to ask you a few questions. They'll probably be dental-related and medical-related just so we can kind of get an idea of what's going on. And then we'll probably just do an exam, take a look in your mouth, and see what we can do and kind of make a plan for you. Does that sound good?' However, the student did not fully elicit all of the patient's concerns at the beginning. The patient mentioned the chief complaint of soreness and potential abscesses, but the student did not ask if there were any other concerns or issues the patient wanted to address during the visit. The student did gather a comprehensive medical and dental history, but this was more about understanding the patient's background rather than negotiating the patient's priorities for the visit. Therefore, the student set an agenda but did not accomplish the complete patient agenda for their visit."

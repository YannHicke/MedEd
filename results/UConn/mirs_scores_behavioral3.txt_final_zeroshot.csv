OPENING,5,"The medical student, Natarcia, successfully includes all key elements in the opening of the interview. She introduces herself ('Hi, Mr. Jones. I'm Natarcia.'), clarifies her role ('I'm a second-year medical student working with Dr. Smith today.'), inquires how to address the patient ('Is it okay if I call you Mr. Jones?'), and uses the patient's name ('Hi, Mr. Jones.'). Therefore, based on the criteria, the student deserves a score of 5."

TIMELINE,Not scored,Not in mapping_items_to_score
ORGANIZATION,4,"The medical student, Natarcia, conducted the interview in a mostly logical and organized manner, with only a few minor deviations. The interview began with an introduction and consent to call the patient by his last name, followed by an exploration of the patient's primary concern about his eating habits. The student then delved into the patient's current diet and past dietary habits, which was a logical progression. However, there were a few instances where the flow could have been smoother. For example, after discussing the patient's current diet, the student abruptly shifted to asking about the patient's daughter's college and then back to the diet (""Is she entering her first year?"" and ""Where is she going to school?""). This could have been streamlined to maintain focus on the dietary concerns. Additionally, the student asked about the patient's general health and medication history, which was relevant but could have been better integrated into the discussion about diet and lifestyle. The transition to discussing the patient's social support and living situation was well-handled, providing a comprehensive view of the patient's context. The student effectively used time to cover all necessary topics, including suggestions for dietary changes and resources for cooking classes. Overall, the interview was well-organized with minor areas for improvement in maintaining a seamless flow."
TRANSITIONAL STATEMENTS,Not scored,Not in mapping_items_to_score
QUESTIONING SKILLS TYPES OF QUESTIONS,3,"The medical student begins the interview with an open-ended question: 'What brings you in today?' This is a good start. However, the student quickly shifts to more specific and direct questions without consistently using open-ended questions to explore major lines of inquiry. For example, 'Why is that?' and 'Is she entering her first year?' are specific questions that follow the initial open-ended question. Additionally, the student uses a 'why' question early on: 'Why is that?' which can be perceived as judgmental. The student also asks multiple questions in a single turn: 'Do you have any other health concerns? Diabetes? No. High blood pressure? No. High cholesterol? Cancer?' This pattern continues throughout the interview, with the student often asking direct questions rather than open-ended ones. While the student does use some open-ended questions, such as 'So before I continue with talking about food and everything, why don't you tell me a little bit about yourself? How is your health?' these are not frequent enough to warrant a higher score. The presence of 'why' questions and multiple questions further justifies the score of 3."
QUESTIONING SKILLS SUMMARIZING,3,"The medical student made some attempts to summarize the data but did not do so consistently or completely. For example, after discussing the patient's current eating habits and health concerns, the student did not provide a comprehensive summary to ensure all information was accurate and complete. The student did summarize the patient's main concern about eating habits and the plan to see a dietician, but this was done towards the end of the interview and was somewhat incomplete. The student also missed opportunities to summarize after discussing the patient's medication, family history, and social history. For instance, after learning about the patient's antidepressant use and its effects, the student could have summarized this information to ensure clarity. Similarly, after discussing the patient's family history and social support, a summary would have been beneficial. Overall, while there were some attempts at summarization, they were not consistent or thorough enough to warrant a higher score."
QUESTIONING SKILLS DUPLICATION,Not scored,Not in mapping_items_to_score
QUESTIONING SKILLS LACK OF JARGON,5,"The medical student consistently used language that was easily understood by the patient and avoided medical jargon throughout the interview. For example, when discussing the patient's diet, the student used simple terms like 'cereal,' 'beef jerky,' and 'whole milk' instead of more complex nutritional terminology. The student also ensured that any potentially unfamiliar terms were explained in a straightforward manner, such as when suggesting the patient see a 'registered dietician' and explaining what the dietician could help with. Additionally, the student used language appropriate to the patient's level of education and understanding, as seen in the discussion about cooking classes and making dietary changes. Overall, the student demonstrated excellent communication skills by keeping the conversation clear and accessible for the patient."
QUESTIONING SKILLS VERIFICATION OF PATIENT INFORMATION,4,"The medical student frequently seeks clarification, verification, and specificity of the patient's responses, demonstrating a clear pattern of following up on important details. For example, the student asks about the specific antidepressant and dosage ('Which antidepressant?' 'It's Zoloft.' 'And how many milligrams?' 'It's 10 milligrams a day.'), and verifies the patient's adherence to the medication ('And you're taking it every day?' 'Yes, I am.'). The student also clarifies the patient's current eating habits and past diet ('So what are you eating these days, then?' 'At this point, I've eaten everything that she left in the refrigerator... And now I'm eating cereal almost every meal.'). However, there are a few minor missed opportunities for further clarification, such as not probing deeper into the patient's irritability and sleep issues or the exact nature of the patient's financial stability. These missed opportunities are minor and do not significantly impact the overall understanding of the patient's situation, hence the score of 4."
VERBAL FACILITATION SKILLS,4,"The medical student, Natarcia, frequently uses facilitation skills throughout the interview, but there are a few missed opportunities and some instances where the application could be more effective. For example, Natarcia uses verbal encouragement and short statements such as 'Nice. Cool. That's great. Thank you. Good for her.' and 'Okay. Great. Absolutely.' These statements help to keep the conversation flowing and show engagement. Additionally, Natarcia echoes the patient's concerns and statements, such as 'So you're here to talk about your eating habits and how to change them and make them better.' and 'So you mentioned your dad. Where does he live?' This helps to validate the patient's experiences and keep the conversation on track. However, there are moments where the facilitation could be more timely or specific. For instance, when the patient mentions feeling irritable and having trouble sleeping, Natarcia could have provided more immediate verbal encouragement or empathy. Overall, Natarcia demonstrates a strong use of facilitation skills, but there is room for improvement in consistency and effectiveness."
EMPATHY AND ACKNOWLEDGING PATIENT CUES,4,"The medical student demonstrates a good level of empathy and acknowledges patient cues throughout the interview. The student uses supportive comments and shows understanding of the patient's situation, although there are some missed opportunities for deeper empathy. For example, when the patient mentions his daughter leaving for college and his struggle with preparing food, the student responds with 'Nice. Cool. That's great. Thank you. Good for her,' which acknowledges the situation but could have been more empathetic. The student does well in understanding the patient's perspective, such as when discussing the patient's eating habits and suggesting practical solutions like seeing a dietician and enrolling in a cooking class. The student also shows support by offering to help set up appointments and follow up. However, the student could have used more NURS techniques to name and respect the patient's emotions explicitly. Overall, the student makes clear attempts to connect emotionally with the patient and provides supportive comments, but there is room for improvement in executing deeper empathy."
PATIENTS PERSPECTIVE & BELIEFS,3,"The medical student makes a reasonable attempt to understand the patient's situation and concerns, particularly around his eating habits and the changes since his daughter left for college. The student asks about the patient's current diet, past diet, and some aspects of his health and social situation. However, the student does not fully explore the patient's feelings, ideas, impact on function, and expectations (FIFE) comprehensively. For example, the student does not ask about the patient's feelings regarding his new eating habits or how he thinks these changes might affect his health in the long term. The student also does not delve deeply into the patient's expectations for treatment or outcomes. While the student does suggest practical solutions like seeing a dietician and taking a cooking class, the exploration of the patient's personal beliefs and perspectives is somewhat superficial. Quotes to support this evaluation include: 'So you're here to talk about your eating habits and how to change them and make them better. Do you have any other concerns for today?' and 'So would you like to discuss making a change?' These questions show an attempt to address the patient's concerns but lack depth in exploring the patient's personal beliefs and feelings about his situation."
IMPACT OF ILLNESS ON PATIENT AND PATIENT_S SELF-IMAGE,5,"The medical student, Natarcia, thoroughly explores the impact of the patient's dietary changes on his life and self-image. She inquires about his feelings and the broader context of his life, including his daughter's departure for college, his living situation, and his social support network. For example, she asks, 'So you're here to talk about your eating habits and how to change them and make them better. Do you have any other concerns for today?' and 'So the Zoloft is making you feel better, but when you are feeling kind of down, do you feel like you have a social support network?' These questions show a deep understanding of how the patient's life circumstances affect his health. Additionally, she offers practical resources and counseling, such as suggesting a registered dietician and a community cooking class, and even offers to help set up these appointments: 'Because one of my suggestions would be to have you talk to a registered dietician' and 'And that would also be a really good way for you to meet people and to get more integrated into your community.' This comprehensive approach and the provision of resources demonstrate a high level of care and support for the patient's well-being."
SUPPORT SYSTEMS,5,"The medical student thoroughly explored the patient's support systems across multiple dimensions. The student inquired about the patient's emotional support by asking about his social interactions and relationships, such as his connection with his daughter, father, and colleagues: 'So the Zoloft is making you feel better, but when you are feeling kind of down, do you feel like you have a social support network?' The student also addressed the patient's financial support by confirming that he has insurance: 'You mentioned that you were financially stable. Did you say if you had insurance?' Additionally, the student suggested appropriate community resources, such as seeing a dietician and enrolling in a cooking class: 'Now, about teaching you how to cook, is there any kind of, do you know of any kind of community resources in your area where they can do classes or little tutorials on cooking?' The student even discussed the potential benefits of these resources for both improving the patient's nutrition and increasing his social interactions. Overall, the student demonstrated a comprehensive approach to understanding and enhancing the patient's support systems."
PATIENTS EDUCATION AND UNDERSTANDING,5,"The medical student, Natarcia, demonstrates a thorough and deliberate approach to ensuring Mr. Jones understands the information provided and is engaged in his own care. She uses several techniques to check his understanding and interest in patient education. For example, she asks if he would be willing to see a dietician and enroll in a cooking class, which he agrees to: 'So that's something you'd be willing to start up with?' and 'So is that something you'd be willing to enroll in?' She also offers practical advice and immediate steps he can take, such as switching to 1% or 2% milk: 'Like, have you thought about trying 1% or 2% milk just to bring down the fat content a bit?' Additionally, she ensures follow-up by suggesting a future appointment to review progress: 'And then we can also have you make an appointment to see me and Dr. Smith in two weeks to see how, if you had the first appointment, how that went.' Natarcia also provides motivational support by discussing the benefits of the proposed changes and how they align with Mr. Jones's goals: 'But you're looking into how to cook, so maybe that's just a default way to make friends.' Overall, her approach is comprehensive and patient-centered, ensuring Mr. Jones feels supported and understood."
ASSESS MOTIVATION FOR CHANGES,5,"The medical student did an excellent job of assessing the patient's motivation for change and offering a range of options and plans to support the change. The student inquired about the patient's feelings and readiness to make dietary changes multiple times throughout the conversation. For example, the student asked, 'So you're here to talk about how you can change that to make it a little bit more healthier for you,' and 'So would you like to discuss making a change?' The student also provided several actionable options, such as seeing a registered dietician, enrolling in a cooking class, and making immediate dietary adjustments like switching to 1% or 2% milk. Additionally, the student offered to follow up with the patient and even suggested signing a contract to solidify the patient's commitment to change. The patient's positive responses, such as 'I'd like to do that as soon as possible' and 'I'm feeling pretty motivated,' indicate that the student successfully engaged the patient in the process of change."
ACHIEVE A SHARED PLAN,5,"The medical student, Natarcia, effectively discusses the patient's concerns about his eating habits and works collaboratively to develop a plan. She invites the patient to contribute his thoughts and preferences throughout the conversation. For example, she asks, 'So you're here to talk about how you can change that to make it a little bit more healthier for you,' and the patient confirms, 'That's exactly why I came.' Natarcia suggests seeing a dietician and asks for the patient's willingness: 'So that's something you'd be willing to start up with?' The patient responds positively, 'I'd like to do that as soon as possible.' Additionally, she explores the patient's interest in a local cooking class and its potential benefits, 'So is that something you'd be willing to enroll in?' and the patient agrees, 'Actually, I was thinking, and yes, that sounds like something I would do.' Natarcia also offers practical immediate changes, such as switching to 1% or 2% milk, and ensures follow-up by scheduling an appointment with the dietician and a follow-up visit with her and Dr. Smith. This comprehensive approach and active involvement of the patient in decision-making justify a score of 5."
ENCOURAGEMENT OF QUESTIONS,5,"The medical student consistently encourages the patient to ask questions and bring up additional topics throughout the interview. For example, early in the conversation, the student says, 'Do you have any other concerns for today?' and 'Let me know if you do, if you remember anything as we're talking.' These statements invite the patient to share more information or ask questions. Later, the student reiterates this openness by saying, 'But I really want you to feel like you can contact the office if you have any questions about nutrition or what you should be eating.' This shows a proactive approach to ensuring the patient feels comfortable bringing up any concerns. The student also checks in multiple times to ensure all the patient's concerns are addressed, such as asking, 'Do you have any other concerns for us today?' This consistent encouragement and openness to patient input justify a score of 5."
CLOSURE,5,"The medical student clearly specifies the future plans at the end of the interview. The student outlines what they will do: 'So I'm going to go talk to Dr. Smith and get you that paperwork, and you just stay right here, and I'll come back.' The student also specifies what the patient will do: 'we could make an appointment with a dietician that you can go talk to about that,' and 'we can also have you make an appointment to see me and Dr. Smith in two weeks to see how, if you had the first appointment, how that went.' Additionally, the student mentions the timing of the next steps: 'And that should start up in two weeks, you said?' and 'we can also have you make an appointment to see me and Dr. Smith in two weeks.' The student provides a comprehensive plan, including immediate actions, follow-up appointments, and additional resources, ensuring the patient knows what to expect next."
ELICITS SPECTRUM OF CONCERNS,5,"The medical student successfully elicited the patient's full spectrum of concerns within the first 3-5 minutes of the interview. The student began by asking the patient what brought him in today and followed up with detailed questions about his eating habits and the changes since his daughter left for college. The student also asked, 'Do you have any other concerns for today?' and 'Let me know if you do, if you remember anything as we're talking,' ensuring that all concerns were addressed. This thorough approach aligns with the criteria for a score of 5."
NEGOTIATES PRIORITIES & SETS AGENDA,3,"The medical student did set an agenda by identifying the patient's primary concern about his eating habits and discussing potential solutions, such as seeing a dietician and enrolling in a cooking class. However, the student did not fully elicit all potential concerns at the beginning of the interview. The student asked, 'Do you have any other concerns for today?' but this was after a detailed discussion about the patient's eating habits. The patient mentioned irritability and sleep issues, which led to a discussion about his antidepressant use, but these were not initially elicited as part of setting the agenda. The student did not get the patient's agreement on the agenda at the onset of the interview. Therefore, the student accomplished a partial agenda but did not fully negotiate the patient's priorities comprehensively. Quotes to support this include: 'So you're here to talk about your eating habits and how to change them and make them better. Do you have any other concerns for today?' and 'Okay. Let me know if you do, if you remember anything as we're talking.'"

OPENING,5,"The medical student, Amy, successfully includes all key elements in the opening of the interview. She introduces herself ('My name is Amy'), clarifies her role ('I'm a medical student working with the doctors here today'), inquires how to address the patient ('Is Mrs. Paulton how you'd like to be addressed?'), and uses the patient's name ('Hi Mrs. Paulton'). Therefore, the introduction is complete and merits a score of 5."
ELICITING THE NARRATIVE THREAD or the PATIENT_S STORY,3,"The medical student begins to let the patient talk about their problem but frequently interrupts with focused questions and introduces new information into the conversation. For example, after the patient mentions the pain, the student immediately asks, 'Is there anything else that you want to make sure we address today before we talk more about that pain?' This pattern continues throughout the interview, with the student often redirecting the conversation to gather specific details ('How much Tylenol did you take?' 'Extra strength or regular?'). While the student does summarize the patient's story towards the end, the overall approach is more Q&A style rather than allowing the patient to narrate their experience uninterrupted."
TIMELINE,5,"The medical student, Amy, successfully establishes a comprehensive timeline of the patient's chief complaint and history of the present illness. She begins by identifying the primary concern: 'I had an episode last night where I had really bad pain low in my belly.' Amy then systematically explores the characteristics of the pain, including its location ('right down here. My right side'), radiation ('it went down into my groin area'), severity ('maybe a ten'), and attempts at relief ('I tried some Tylenol... I took two tablets... regular strength'). She also inquires about associated symptoms such as urinary frequency ('I kept having, feeling like I had to pee'), the appearance of the urine ('kind of, I don't know, brownish color'), and nausea ('I was nauseous off and on'). Amy further confirms the absence of other symptoms like vomiting, diarrhea, and fever. She summarizes the information effectively: 'So you've had this pain that woke you up out of sleep this morning... Moves into your groin a little bit... you tried to walk around, took some Tylenol, nothing really helped... you also had this feeling that you had to pee... you finally were able to pass some urine, but you noticed it was kind of a funny reddish color... you had some nausea, but no vomiting.' This thorough approach ensures that a clear chronology of the chief complaint and associated symptoms is established, justifying a score of 5."
ORGANIZATION,5,"The medical student demonstrated excellent organization throughout the interview. The conversation began with a clear introduction and confirmation of the patient's preferred form of address. The student then effectively prioritized the patient's concerns, focusing first on the more urgent issue of pain before addressing the secondary concern of incontinence. The student used logical sequencing in the questions, starting with the history of the present illness, followed by a review of systems, past medical history, family history, and social history. For example, the student asked about the location, nature, and severity of the pain before moving on to associated symptoms and potential alleviating or aggravating factors. The student also summarized the information gathered to ensure accuracy and completeness, as seen in the following exchange: 'Okay. So I just want to kind of summarize what you've told me so far since I jumped around a little bit and make sure that I got everything right. If anything's wrong, let me know for sure, or if we forgot anything.' This summary helped maintain clarity and organization. Time was managed effectively, with the student covering all necessary topics within the allotted time and ensuring that the patient felt heard and understood. The transitions between different sections of the interview were smooth, and the student maintained a logical flow throughout. Overall, the student's performance aligns with the criteria for a score of 5."

QUESTIONING SKILLS TYPES OF QUESTIONS,4,"The medical student, Amy, begins the information gathering with an open-ended question: 'So, I just wanted to start by figuring out why you're here today.' This is followed by more specific questions to gather detailed information about the patient's symptoms. Amy mostly uses open-ended questions to start major lines of inquiry, such as 'Can you tell me a little bit more about the pain?' and 'Were there any other symptoms that you noticed at the same time as you had this pain?' However, there are instances where she starts with more specific questions, such as 'What kind of pain was it?' and 'How much Tylenol did you take?' The follow-up questions are mostly appropriate and help in gathering detailed information. There are very few poor question types used, with no leading, why, or multiple questions evident. Overall, Amy's questioning skills are strong, but the occasional use of specific questions to start a line of inquiry prevents a perfect score."
QUESTIONING SKILLS SUMMARIZING,5,"The medical student demonstrated excellent summarization skills throughout the interview. They provided a comprehensive summary of the patient's history of present illness (HPI) towards the end of the interview, ensuring that all major points were covered and verified with the patient. For example, the student said, 'So I just want to kind of summarize what you've told me so far since I jumped around a little bit and make sure that I got everything right. If anything's wrong, let me know for sure, or if we forgot anything.' They then proceeded to accurately summarize the patient's symptoms, including the pain, its severity, location, associated urinary symptoms, and other relevant details. The student also checked for any missed information by asking, 'Does that sound like a reasonable summary? Anything I missed?' This approach ensured that the patient's history was complete and accurate. Additionally, the student provided another brief summary towards the end of the interview, stating, 'Okay, so I feel like we've gotten a pretty good sense today of the different symptoms that you've been having and I understand that you've been having this really terrible pain and so I think we need to really figure out what's going on with that.' This further reinforced the thoroughness of their summarization skills."
QUESTIONING SKILLS DUPLICATION,4,"The medical student, Amy, generally avoids repeating questions unnecessarily and maintains a good flow throughout the interview. However, there are a few instances where she repeats questions or seeks information that has already been provided, albeit for clarification or summarization purposes. For example, after the patient describes the pain and its characteristics, Amy asks again, 'And you said the pain does radiate a little bit. It moves into your groin a little bit,' which the patient had already mentioned. Additionally, Amy asks about medications twice: 'Are there any other medicines that you take on a regular basis?' and later, 'How about medications? We already talked about the Tums that you're taking. You've taken some Tylenol. Do you take any other medicines?' These repetitions seem to be for clarification rather than due to a failure to remember the information. Therefore, a score of 4 is appropriate as the student only rarely repeats questions and does so primarily for clarification."
QUESTIONING SKILLS LACK OF JARGON,5,"The medical student consistently used language that was easily understood by the patient and avoided medical jargon throughout the interview. For example, instead of using the term 'dysuria,' the student asked, 'Have you had any pain with urinating?' Similarly, the student used 'pee' instead of 'urinate,' which is more colloquial and likely more familiar to the patient. When discussing the patient's use of Tums, the student explained, 'That may be too many. We'll have to talk a little bit more about that later. Certainly, they're not doing anything terrible to you, but we should probably talk about some other ways to get some calcium into your system,' which is clear and avoids unnecessary medical terminology. The student also used a pain scale ('If you had to qualify it or quantify it on a scale where zero is no pain and ten is the worst thing ever, where would you put it?') that is straightforward and commonly understood. Overall, the language used was appropriate to the patient's level of education and free of difficult medical terms, justifying a score of 5."
QUESTIONING SKILLS VERIFICATION OF PATIENT INFORMATION,5,"The medical student consistently sought clarification, verification, and specificity throughout the interview. For example, when the patient mentioned taking Tylenol, the student asked, 'How much Tylenol did you take?' and followed up with 'Extra strength or regular?' to ensure accurate information. The student also clarified the patient's fluid intake by asking, 'What do you normally drink during the day?' and verified the patient's medication use by asking, 'Do you take any other medicines?' Additionally, the student summarized the patient's symptoms and asked for confirmation, 'Does that sound like a reasonable summary? Anything I missed?' This thorough approach demonstrates a consistent effort to understand the patient's situation fully, justifying a score of 5."
VERBAL FACILITATION SKILLS,4,"The medical student, Amy, frequently uses facilitation skills throughout the interview, but there are a few missed opportunities and some areas where the application could be more effective. Amy uses verbal encouragement and short statements to keep the patient talking, such as 'Okay,' 'All right,' and 'That must have been scary.' She also echoes the patient's statements to show understanding, like when she says, 'Okay. So you've had this pain that woke you up out of sleep this morning. It was really severe, tearing pain in your right side, about a 10 out of 10, really one of the worst pains you've ever had.' However, there are moments where more specific verbal encouragement could have been used to delve deeper into the patient's concerns, such as when the patient mentions feeling nauseous or having brownish urine. Overall, Amy demonstrates a strong use of facilitation skills but falls short of the consistency and effectiveness required for a perfect score."
EMPATHY AND ACKNOWLEDGING PATIENT CUES,4,"The medical student, Amy, demonstrates a good level of empathy throughout the interview, though there are some missed opportunities for deeper connection. She uses supportive comments and acknowledges the patient's emotions, such as when she says, 'That must have been scary,' and 'It sounds like it was pretty scary.' These comments show an understanding of the patient's emotional state. Amy also uses techniques to ensure the patient feels heard and understood, like summarizing the patient's concerns and asking for confirmation: 'Okay. So you've had this pain that woke you up out of sleep this morning... Does that sound like a reasonable summary? Anything I missed?' This shows an effort to respect and support the patient's experience. However, there are moments where Amy could have delved deeper into the patient's emotional state or provided more reassurance, such as when the patient mentions the pain being 'really bad' and 'very frightening.' Overall, Amy's performance is strong, but with room for improvement in consistently employing deeper empathetic techniques."
PATIENTS PERSPECTIVE & BELIEFS,Not scored,Not in mapping_items_to_score
IMPACT OF ILLNESS ON PATIENT AND PATIENT_S SELF-IMAGE,1,"The medical student, Amy, conducted a thorough history-taking and addressed the patient's immediate medical concerns, such as the severe abdominal pain and urinary issues. However, there was no exploration of the impact of the illness on the patient's life or self-image. Amy did not inquire about how the pain or urinary incontinence might be affecting the patient's daily activities, emotional well-being, or self-perception. There was also no offer of counseling or resources to help the patient cope with these issues. The focus remained strictly on the medical symptoms and potential diagnoses, without delving into the broader impact on the patient's life. For example, Amy could have asked, 'How has this pain and the urinary issues been affecting your daily life?' or 'Is there anything about these symptoms that particularly worries you or makes you feel anxious?' These types of questions were absent from the interview."
SUPPORT SYSTEMS,1,"The medical student did not explore the patient's support systems at all during the interview. The conversation focused solely on the patient's symptoms, medical history, and lifestyle habits. There were no questions or discussions about the patient's emotional support, financial support, or other resources available to the patient and family. For example, the student did not ask about the patient's family dynamics, social support, or any community resources that might be available to her. Therefore, based on the provided rubric, the student fails to determine what support is currently available to the patient."

ENCOURAGEMENT OF QUESTIONS,5,"The medical student consistently encouraged the patient to ask questions and bring up additional topics throughout the interview. Early in the conversation, the student asked, 'Is there anything else that you want to make sure we address today before we talk more about that pain?' and 'Is there anything else you can think of that you want to make sure we don't miss today?' These questions provided the patient with multiple opportunities to bring up additional concerns. The student also summarized the patient's information and asked, 'Does that sound like a reasonable summary? Anything I missed?' which further encouraged the patient to add any missed details. Finally, before concluding, the student asked, 'Is there anything that you wanted to ask me? Any questions that you have?' This consistent pattern of encouraging patient input and questions demonstrates a high level of engagement and openness, justifying a score of 5."
CLOSURE,2,"The medical student makes limited attempts to specify future plans at the end of the interview. The student mentions that they will do a physical exam and then discuss the findings and plan together: 'I think at this point it would be good for us to do physical exam, get some more information, and then after that we can talk and I'll tell you what I'm thinking about what it might be and we can talk together about what our plan will be to go from here.' However, the information provided is somewhat vague and incomplete. The student does not specify what the patient should do next or when the next communication or appointment will be. The patient is left with an unclear sense of what to expect beyond the immediate physical exam."
ELICITS SPECTRUM OF CONCERNS,5,"The medical student, Amy, effectively elicited the patient's full spectrum of concerns within the first 3-5 minutes of the interview. She started by asking why the patient was there and followed up with a question to ensure all concerns were addressed: 'Is there anything else that you want to make sure we address today before we talk more about that pain?' The patient mentioned a secondary concern about leaking urine, and Amy confirmed there were no other concerns by asking, 'Is there anything else you can think of that you want to make sure we don't miss today?' The patient responded with 'No,' indicating that all concerns had been raised. This thorough approach aligns with the criteria for a score of 5."
NEGOTIATES PRIORITIES & SETS AGENDA,5,"The medical student, Amy, fully negotiates the priorities of the patient's concerns and sets the agenda at the onset of the interview. She begins by asking, 'Is there anything else that you want to make sure we address today before we talk more about that pain?' and follows up with, 'Is there anything else you can think of that you want to make sure we don't miss today?' This ensures that all of the patient's concerns are listed. Amy then sets the agenda by stating, 'Well, it sounds like the pain is a little bit more urgent right now. So, we'll start with the pain. We may get a little bit of a chance to talk about the incontinence as well... Does that sound okay?' The patient agrees to this agenda. Throughout the interview, Amy revisits the patient's concerns and ensures that they are addressed, demonstrating a thorough and patient-centered approach. This performance aligns with the criteria for a score of 5."

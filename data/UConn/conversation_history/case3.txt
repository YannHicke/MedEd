Physician: Hi, I'm Brianna. I'm a medical student.

Patient: I'm Dan. 

Physician: Nice to meet you, Dan. Is that how you'd like to be addressed today?

Patient: Please.

Physician: Okay, so I'd like to just talk with you for a little bit before the doctor comes in about what brings you in. Is that okay?

Patient: Sure.

Physician: All right, so tell me a little bit about what brought you to the office today.

Patient: Well, I'm having a pain in the left part of my chest and I'm worried it could be my heart.

Physician: Oh, I'm really sorry to hear about that. Can you tell me a little bit about that?

Patient: Sure. It's an aching pain and sometimes it gets sharp and it moves a little bit and I hear that can be heart pain.

Physician: Oh, okay. And what makes it sharp?

Patient: When I move, when I lift things with my left arm.

Physician: Okay, and is there anything that makes the pain better?

Patient: I've been taking some Advil. That's helped a little bit.

Physician: Okay, how much Advil are you taking?

Patient: Two in the morning and two in the afternoon.

Physician: Okay, do you know what the dose is of the Advil?

Patient: I don't.

Physician: Okay, anything else that makes your pain better?

Patient: Just not moving.

Physician: Okay, and you said lifting makes it worse.

Patient: Yeah.

Physician: Okay, do you lift on a regular basis or did you notice it somehow?

Patient: Past few days, I've just been not moving and being low-key with it, seeing if it get better, but I'm gonna have to go back to work in a couple days and I do a lot of lifting for my job and I'm worried if that's gonna interfere with that or if it's my heart, it might make it worse.

Physician: Okay, so you mentioned a couple days. It's been going on for how long now?

Patient: It started about two nights ago.

Physician: Two nights ago. Okay, and is it getting better or worse over time?

Patient: It's about the same.

Physician: About the same. Okay, and you're gonna be going back to work tomorrow, you said?

Patient: Yeah.

Physician: Okay, and you lift boxes at work?

Patient: I do.

Physician: Okay, and do you think your boss would be okay with you taking some time off if you needed to?

Patient: Sure, if I get a doctor's note.

Physician: Okay, I'll see if I can do that for you. Do you have any other symptoms besides the pain in your chest?

Patient: No.

Physician: Okay, like any coughing, any shortness of breath?

Patient: No. 

Physician: Nothing like that? Okay. So I'd just like to summarize a little bit. So it sounds like you've had chest pain for two days now. Sometimes it's an ache, sometimes it's sharp. It's made worse if you're lifting things and you're worried because at work you lift boxes. It's made better by Advil. You said you've taken like two in the morning, two in the afternoon. That seems to help. You're not sure what the dose is on that. And it doesn't radiate anywhere. You have no other symptoms with that. Does that sound about right?

Patient: Yeah.

Physician: Okay. In terms of your past medical history, do you have any ongoing medical problems?

Patient: Nothing serious.

Physician: Nothing serious? Okay. Do you take any medicines on a daily basis?

Patient: Occasionally for my allergies.

Physician: Okay. Do you know what it is that you take for your allergies?

Patient: Flonase.

Physician: Flonase. Okay. Any other vitamins or supplements that you take?

Patient: I take fish oil.

Physician: Okay. And how much fish oil are you taking?

Patient: One pill a day.

Physician: Okay. And why is it that you take fish oil?

Patient: I just hear that's good for heart health.

Physician: Okay. How long have you been doing that for?

Patient: A long time. Past ten years or so.

Physician: Okay. And you mentioned you have allergies. Is that seasonal allergies?

Patient: Yeah. Sometimes in the fall I get a bit of a sinus drip.

Physician: Okay. Any other allergies that you have?

Patient: Nope.

Physician: Okay. Have you ever had surgery before?

Patient: No.

Physician: Have you ever been hospitalized or been to the emergency room?

Patient: No.

Physician: No? Okay. And how about your family history? Can you tell me a little bit about that?

Patient: Well, my mom grew up with diabetes and she had some heart issues. And when I was young she even had to have surgery on her heart.

Physician: Oh, okay. So you said she grew up with diabetes so she's had diabetes for a long time.

Patient: Mm-hmm.

Physician: Does she use insulin for that?

Patient: She does.

Physician: Okay. And you said she also had a heart surgery?

Patient: Yeah. When she was younger than I am now, she had to have surgery on her heart valves.

Physician: Oh, okay. Anyone else in your family with diabetes?

Patient: No.

Physician: Anyone else in your family with heart problems?

Patient: No.

Physician: No? Okay. So just to summarize your past medical history, it sounds like you're pretty healthy. You just have seasonal allergies in the fall. And you said you take Flonase for that?

Patient: Yep.

Physician: Yep. And then you said you've been taking fish oil for the past several years for heart health.

Patient: Mm-hmm.

Physician: And you haven't been hospitalized or anything like that. And your mom has diabetes for which she uses insulin.

Patient: Yep.

Physician: And she's had surgery on her heart valves in the past. Okay. So in terms of your social history, we talked about your work. You lift boxes. Can you tell me about your living situation?

Patient: Yeah. I live at home in a condo by myself.

Physician: Okay. And do you have any family or friends in the area?

Patient: My family lives about 45 minutes away.

Physician: Okay. And do you have any friends or significant other?

Patient: My girlfriend lives in town.

Physician: Okay. So do you think that you could look to your girlfriend in a time of need for her to help you out if you were sick or anything like that?

Patient: Yeah. I've been keeping her updated when she was over and helped me cook. So that stuff's okay. I'm just worried about when I go back to work.

Physician: Okay. Well, that's understandable. And in terms of other recreational activities, what do you like to do in your free time?

Patient: I like to mountain bike.

Physician: You like to mountain bike. Okay. Have you been mountain biking recently?

Patient: Yeah. Actually, I was doing that the night of when I first got the chest pain.

Physician: Oh, okay. So you're mountain biking and what happened with that with the chest pain?

Patient: Well, I was getting late and we wanted to do, I was at my friend Ben's house and we wanted to go down the mountain one more time before it got dark. So we were kind of rushed and I fell off towards the end, hit a bump that I didn't quite see, hit myself on the bike as I fell. I was okay. Sometimes that happens. But I was worried that the jolt because of where it hit me might've shaken up things in my chest a little bit.

Physician: Oh, I see. Okay. So you hit your chest when you were mountain biking and your chest pain started after that.

Patient: Yeah.

Physician: Okay. And in terms of other things that you do in your free time, do you drink any alcohol?

Patient: Yep. I do on the weekends.

Physician: On the weekends. Okay. How much do you drink on the weekends?

Patient: Usually about a six pack.

Physician: Okay. And so you were mountain biking on the weekend and you drink on the weekend. Had you been drinking at the time when you were mountain biking?

Patient: Yeah.

Physician: Okay. Do you think that that affected you at all?

Patient: I don't think so. I mean, I didn't completely finish the six beers, but, and that's, you know, something I'm used to.

Physician: Okay. Have you ever been injured when drinking in the past?

Patient: Like I said, I, you know, mountain biking, sometimes you, you slip or you might fall a little bit or some branches hit you. But, you know, never anything that hurt my heart before.

Physician: Okay. And do you smoke any cigarettes?

Patient: Occasionally when I drink or I'm hanging out with my friends.

Physician: Okay. And do you use any drugs?

Patient: I don't.

Physician: You don't. Okay. So it sounds like you, we already talked about your job and you lift boxes at work and your free time you like to mountain bike and you do drink about a six pack of beer on the weekends and you have been drinking and mountain biking at the same time. And this past weekend you were mountain biking when your chest pain started because you fell off your mountain bike.

Patient: Yes.

Physician: Okay. And you mentioned you also occasionally smoke cigarettes and you don't use any drugs. Is that correct?

Patient: That's true.

Physician: Okay. So it sounds like there's a possibility that your chest pain could be related to the mountain biking incident. And I will talk with my doctor and you can wait here. I'll be back in a few minutes.

Patient: Okay. Great. Thank you.

Physician: All right.

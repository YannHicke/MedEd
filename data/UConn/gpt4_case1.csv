Opening,3,"The physician commences the interview with a greeting using the patient's name ('Hi, Mrs. Paulton?'), introduces themselves by name ('Hi, my name is Amy. It's nice to meet you.'), and immediately moves on to inquire about the patient's visit ('So what brings you in today?'). While the physician uses the patient's name and introduces themselves by their first name, they do not clarify their professional role directly (e.g., stating they're a doctor or their specific specialty) nor do they explicitly ask the patient how they prefer to be addressed. This interaction misses two elements of the full introduction criteria: clarifying their professional role and inquiring how the patient prefers to be addressed. Therefore, according to the scoring criteria, this introduction would be rated a 3 for missing two elements of a full introduction."
ELICITS SPECTRUM OF CONCERNS,3,"The interviewer focused solely on understanding the patient's main concern regarding the episode of severe abdominal pain she experienced, without explicitly probing for any additional concerns the patient might have had. Although extensive questioning regarding the symptoms and surrounding circumstances of the main issue was conducted, there was no specific 'what else' question posed to encourage the patient to bring up any other unrelated or secondary concerns. The physician did follow up with a thorough history that included lifestyle, medical history, and family history, but this was after discussing the primary issue rather than initially asking about any other concerns upfront."
NEGOTIATES PRIORITIES & SETS AGENDA,1,"In this conversation, the Physician begins by eliciting information about the patient's chief concern through open-ended questions such as 'So what brings you in today?' and 'Can you start from the beginning and really tell me everything you can remember about when it started?'. The Physician takes a detailed history of the patient's symptoms, including onset, duration, characteristics of the pain, and any associated symptoms, thereby gathering comprehensive information about the patient's condition. However, there is no evidence in the transcript that the Physician explicitly negotiates priorities of patient concerns, lists all of the concerns, or sets a clear agenda at the onset of the interview with the patient’s agreement. The conversation focuses mainly on the chief concern presented by the patient without explicitly checking if there are other concerns the patient wants to address during the visit or setting a clear agenda for the discussion. Based on the criteria provided, the Physician does not score a 5, as there's no negotiation of priorities or setting of the agenda with the patient's agreement. Similarly, scores 4, 3, and 2 aren't met since there's no explicit setting of a full agenda, negotiation of priorities, or partial listing of concerns with an intention to set an agenda. Thus, the Physician's actions align most closely with a score of 1, where the Physician focuses on the chief complaint without explicitly negotiating priorities or setting an agenda, considering mainly the physician's needs to understand and address the acute symptomatology."
ELICITING THE NARRATIVE THREAD or the ‘PATIENT’S STORY’,5,"The interviewer, in this case, performs exceptionally in facilitating the patient to narrate her experience without interruptions, enabling a complete narrative thread. From the initial open-ended question, 'So what brings you in today?' to more specific follow-ups like 'Can you start from the beginning and really tell me everything you can remember about when it started?' the interviewer effectively encourages the patient to share in detail. There are no instances where the physician interrupts the patient's story with unrelated questions or topics. Instead, each question is directly related to understanding the patient's condition better, such as 'Can you tell me more about the pain?' and 'How long did the pain last?' Even when moving on to general health questions, the transition is smooth, with the interviewer signaling a shift in focus ('I just want to move on now and ask you some more questions about your health.'). The overall conversation maintains a patient-centered approach, focusing on gathering comprehensive information about the patient's symptoms, personal health, and family history without diverting or dominating the conversation."
TIMELINE,5,"The interviewer demonstrated competency in establishing a timeline and understanding the progression of the patient's chief concern and history of the present illness. The interviewer effectively guides the patient to describe the onset of symptoms ('It woke me up last night a little after, I'd say about 1 o'clock...'), characterizes the symptoms ('...really bad pain, low down in my belly...'), explores their evolution ('Anything you did to try to help it?'), and establishes when they resolved ('I'd say a little before 5 o'clock this morning, all of a sudden, the pain went away.'). Furthermore, the interviewer inquires about associated symptoms such as changes in urination ('...I felt like I had to pee...only little teeny amounts would come out'), changes in the appearance of the urine ('I did notice it was a little bit brown colored.'), and other systemic symptoms like nausea and sweating. These questions help to clear the picture of the patient's illness over the course of the night, providing a timeline that tracks the start, course, and temporary resolution of symptoms. While there could perhaps be even further exploration of exact symptom onset related to specific activities or the detailed chronology of symptom fluctuation, the information gathered provides a solid chronological understanding of the patient's illness."
ORGANIZATION,5,"The Physician conducts the interview in a highly organized manner, efficiently moving through a structured series of questions that logically flow from introductory greetings to inquiries about the specific episode of concern, its symptoms, and impacts. The conversation progresses smoothly from exploring the cause of the visit ('So what brings you in today?') towards a detailed exploration of symptoms (e.g., 'Can you tell me more about the pain?'), any actions taken by the patient to alleviate those symptoms, and any relevant personal and family medical history. Questions about health habits and the patient's daily life are appropriately placed after urgent issues related to the visit have been thoroughly discussed. The transition from discussing the immediate incident to broader health inquiries ('Okay. I just want to move on now and ask you some more questions about your health.') signals a clear organizational plan where the Physician prioritizes understanding the acute issue before moving on to general health inquiries. This sequence ensures that nothing is overlooked and that the interview remains patient-centered and relevant. Tasks are completed efficiently within the time allowed, adhering to clinical relevance and prioritization of the patient's immediate needs and health history."
TRANSITIONAL STATEMENTS (only for complete histories),5,"The interviewer, in this case the physician, utilizes transitional statements effectively throughout the patient interview, clearly delineating the structure of the conversation for the patient. For instance, the transition into the patient's medical history is initiated with ""I just want to move on now and ask you some more questions about your health,"" providing a clear marker to the patient that the conversation is moving into a new section. Similarly, transitions into the family history and lifestyle and habits sections are smoothly handled with statements like ""All right. I just want to ask you now about your family history"" and ""So I'm just going to move on now and ask you some questions about your daily life and some of your health habits."" These statements not only signal a new topic but also help to mentally prepare the patient for the type of information that will be discussed next. Such transitions contribute to a structured and logically flowing conversation, minimizing confusion and ensuring the patient understands the progression of topics."
PACING OF INTERVIEW (not based on finishing on time),5,"Throughout the interview, the physician, Amy, demonstrates a high level of attentiveness to Mrs. Paulton’s descriptions of her symptoms and overall health history. She listens without interrupting, allowing Mrs. Paulton to fully express her concerns and the details of her symptoms. For instance, when Mrs. Paulton describes her pain, Amy probes further with questions like, 'Can you tell me more about the pain? It was a tearing pain.' and 'And did it move anywhere?' highlighting her attentiveness to understand the nature and progression of the pain. There are no apparent awkward pauses; the conversation flows smoothly from one topic to another, demonstrating a well-paced interview. Additionally, Amy uses silence effectively, allowing Mrs. Paulton space to recall and describe her symptoms and experiences without rushing her. This careful pacing and use of silence are especially notable when transitioning from discussing symptoms to asking about Mrs. Paulton’s overall health, family history, and lifestyle. Amy’s responses, such as 'Okay. All right.' and 'Mm-hmm.', and her move to the next question only after Mrs. Paulton has finished speaking, indicate that she is processing the information thoughtfully rather than hurrying through the interview. There is a thorough yet efficient gathering of information without any interruptions from the physician that would detract from understanding the patient's health issue."
QUESTIONING SKILLS – TYPES OF QUESTIONS,5,"The interviewer (Physician) skillfully initiates each major line of questioning with open-ended questions to encourage comprehensive patient responses, which aligns well with the criteria for a score of 5. The opening question, 'So what brings you in today?' serves as a broad, open-ended question inviting the patient to share their reason for the visit in their own words. Follow-up inquiries further explore the patient's symptoms with specific, direct questions based on the information initially provided by the patient, such as, 'Can you start from the beginning and really tell me everything you can remember about when it started?' and 'Can you tell me more about the pain? It was a tearing pain.' These progressions from open-ended to more specific questioning demonstrate a clear structure designed to gather detailed information without leading the patient or asking multiple questions simultaneously. The interviewer's approach is consistently patient-centered, allowing the patient to describe their symptoms, experiences, and even life habits in a way that contributes to a comprehensive understanding of the patient's condition without introducing bias or leading questions. This methodical approach, alternating between open-ended and specific questions without relying on why questions, multiple questions, or leading questions, supports a score of 5."
QUESTIONING SKILLS - SUMMARIZING,1,"Throughout the interview, the interviewer (physician) consistently engages in clarifying and probing for details but does not explicitly summarize the data obtained at the end of each major line of inquiry or subsection. The conversation seamlessly transitions from one set of questions to the next, covering symptoms, health history, and lifestyle without pausing to summarize or verify the accuracy of the information gathered. While the interviewer's approach ensures a thorough understanding of the patient's situation, the lack of explicit summarization at the end of each section or the overall interview before proceeding to next steps means that it does not meet the criteria for a score of 5. For example, after discussing the initial symptom details, the interviewer moves on to inquire about other symptoms and health history without summarizing the patient's initial presentation for verification. Therefore, according to the provided scoring criteria, this approach warrants a score of 1."
QUESTIONING SKILLS - DUPLICATION,5,"Throughout the conversation, the physician does not repeat questions unnecessarily. Each question builds upon the information already provided by the patient to gather more detailed insights into the patient's condition. The physician asks follow-up questions for clarification and to expand on the details given, such as when inquiring about the nature and specifics of the pain, its timing, and associated symptoms, but does not ask for the same information twice. Even when similar topics are addressed, such as the pain or attempts to alleviate it, these are either new questions aiming to deepen understanding or to confirm information in a different context. This indicates a thoughtful approach to gathering comprehensive patient history without redundant repetition."
QUESTIONING SKILLS - LACK OF JARGON,5,"The interviewer, in this case, the physician, uses language that is easily understood by the patient throughout the conversation, effectively avoiding medical jargon. When discussing symptoms, the physician asks questions using everyday language, such as 'Can you start from the beginning and really tell me everything you can remember about when it started?' and 'Anything you did to try to help it?'. The physician also phrases questions in a way that a person without a medical background can easily understand, for example, asking 'Have you had any changes in your bowels?' followed by 'Like diarrhea, constipation?' rather than using terms that might be unfamiliar to the patient. The discussion about the patient's health, symptoms, and lifestyle is conducted without resorting to complex medical terminology that might confuse someone without a healthcare background. This approach ensures that the patient can follow the conversation and contribute meaningfully to it, facilitating an effective dialogue about their health concerns."
QUESTIONING SKILLS - VERIFICATION OF PATIENT INFORMATION (in vignette),5,"The interviewer (physician) exhibits consistent efforts in seeking clarification, verification, and specificity throughout the conversation with the patient. For instance, the physician meticulously clarifies the onset, nature, and specifics of the pain by asking, ""Can you start from the beginning and really tell me everything you can remember about when it started?"" and ""Can you tell me more about the pain? It was a tearing pain."" Further, the physician verifies the location of the pain, ""And where was it?"", and probes for additional symptoms and their duration to gain a comprehensive understanding of the patient's condition, exemplified by questions like ""How long did the pain last?"" and ""Okay. Any other symptoms that you felt at the same time?"" Additionally, there are diligent checks for related health information, including past medical history, medication use, and lifestyle factors, as seen in inquiries such as ""Have you been in the hospital ever?"", ""Just want to ask you also if there are any medicines that you take."", and discussions surrounding the patient's daily life and health habits. These thorough lines of questioning, aimed at building a complete picture of the patient's health status and episode, demonstrate a systematic approach to ensuring a clear and accurate understanding of the patient's symptoms and overall health, aligning with a score of 5."
INTERACTIVE TECHNIQUES,5,"The interviewer demonstrates a balanced approach between patient-centered and physician-centered styles throughout the conversation. Initially, the interviewer effectively utilizes patient-centered techniques, allowing the patient to tell her story and share her concerns without interruption ('Can you start from the beginning and really tell me everything you can remember about when it started?'). The questioning style is open-ended, encouraging the patient to describe her symptoms thoroughly, including the nature of the pain, its timing, and associated symptoms (e.g., 'Can you tell me more about the pain? It was a tearing pain.'). The interviewer listens attentively and responds empathetically ('Sounds like it was a long morning for you.'). As the conversation progresses, the interviewer seamlessly transitions to a more physician-centered approach by asking specific, targeted questions to gather comprehensive health, family, and social history ('Do you see a doctor regularly?', 'Have you been in the hospital ever?', 'Do you drink alcohol?'). However, this shift does not undermine patient autonomy or involvement; instead, it ensures a thorough assessment without deviating from a negotiated agenda with the patient. The interviewer successfully balances eliciting detailed information from the patient with gathering necessary clinical information for diagnosis and management. Thus, the interview reflects a collaborative partnership between patient and physician, achieving an optimal blend of interviewing styles."
VERBAL FACILITATION SKILLS,4,"The interviewer, in this case, the physician, consistently uses verbal encouragement and facilitative skills throughout the interaction with the patient. The physician repeatedly employs phrases that acknowledge the patient's responses, such as ""Okay,"" ""All right,"" and ""I see,"" which serve to confirm that the patient's input is heard and valued. Moreover, the interviewer skillfully guides the patient through her recount by asking clarifying questions (e.g., ""Can you tell me more about the pain?"" and ""And did it move anywhere?"") and echoing the patient's statements (e.g., ""So it woke you up out of sleep."") to encourage further detail. There is a consistent effort to draw out a comprehensive narrative about the patient's symptoms and experiences, demonstrated by probes for elaboration on specific aspects of the patient's episode (""Can you start from the beginning and really tell me everything you can remember about when it started?""). Additionally, the interviewer shows empathy and validation toward the patient's ordeal (""Sounds like it was a long morning for you."") and concludes by summarizing the step forward (""So at this point, I think we just need to do the physical exam, see if you need any tests, and then we'll move on from there.""), which reassures the patient about the next steps. However, there's a missed opportunity for verbal praise for the patient's healthcare engagement or direct encouragement statements that could have further enhanced the supportive atmosphere. Despite this slight area for improvement, the overall interaction demonstrates a high degree of verbal encouragement and facilitation skills."
NON-VERBAL FACILITATION SKILLS,Not applicable,"The provided conversation is entirely textual and does not include specific descriptions of non-verbal communication elements such as the interviewer's body language, facial expressions, use of physical space, or forms of physical contact. As a result, it's challenging to accurately assign a score based on non-verbal communication skills in facilitating the interview and putting the patient at ease. The scoring criteria rely heavily on observing non-verbal cues and behaviors, which are not conveyed through the text. Therefore, without explicit details on the interviewer's non-verbal communication, any score given would be speculative."
EMPATHY AND ACKNOWLEDGING PATIENT CUES,3,"Throughout the conversation, the physician demonstrates a neutral approach in gathering information from the patient, focusing on understanding the specifics of the patient's condition without explicitly using empathetic techniques or making supportive comments regarding the patient's emotions. The physician does acknowledge the patient's experience by summarizing or reiterating information ('Sounds like it was a long morning for you.') and asking clarifying questions about the patient's symptoms and history to get a comprehensive understanding of the situation. However, there is a lack of direct expressions of empathy or emotional support that would involve naming the patient's feelings, showing understanding, respecting their experience, or explicitly offering support in a manner that utilizes NURS or similar empathetic techniques. The physician's interaction seems more guided towards clinical assessment than emotional support. Therefore, the conversation does not fully meet the criteria for a score of 5 as it lacks the use of specific empathetic techniques such as NURS. Nevertheless, the physician's approach is not negative or critical, and there is a mild acknowledgment of the patient's difficult experience, which would not warrant a score of 1."
PATIENT’S PERSPECTIVE (BELIEFS; Case specific),3,"The interviewer obtained a detailed account of the patient's symptoms, including the onset, nature, and progression of pain, as well as other associated symptoms. The physician also explored the patient's health history, family history, personal habits, and support system. However, the physician's questions primarily focused on clinical symptoms and history taking, rather than explicitly exploring the patient's beliefs, feelings, ideas about the cause of her symptoms, her functioning given her symptoms, or her expectations for treatment and recovery (FIFE). While the conversation establishes an understanding of the patient's experience from a clinical perspective, it does not delve into the patient's healing practices or perspectives on the illness in terms of her personal beliefs or cultural understandings of the pain and symptoms. Therefore, the conversation does not meet the criteria for scoring a 5. Since the interviewer does solicit the patient's perspective on the illness in terms of symptoms and impact on daily life but does not address or follow through on her beliefs or expectations about her condition, the interaction is more aligned with a score of 3."
IMPACT OF ILLNESS ON PATIENT AND PATIENT’S SELF-IMAGE,3,"The physician, Dr. Amy, did engage in collecting a detailed history of the patient's symptoms and medical background but only partially addressed the impact of the illness on the patient's life. Dr. Amy inquired about the patient missing work ('So are you missing work today?') and about the patient's support systems ('Can you tell me a little bit about your support systems?'). These questions show an attempt to understand the broader impact of the illness. However, there was no exploration of the patient's feelings about the illness or discussion on how it may have changed the patient's life beyond these aspects. The interviewer offers no counseling or resources to help, which would have been part of a more comprehensive exploration of the illness's impact and would be necessary to score higher. Therefore, according to the given guidelines, the appropriate score is a 3."
IMPACT OF ILLNESS ON FAMILY,3,"The interviewer, in this case, the physician, acknowledges the presence and potential support role of the patient's husband but does not thoroughly explore the broader impact of the patient's illness on the family structure or how it affects them beyond the immediate context of the episode. While mentioning the husband as a main support system and indicating his involvement during the episode, there is no further inquiry into how the patient's condition may be affecting their family life, responsibilities, or emotional well-being. Although there is an acknowledgment of the husband's support (""Yeah. And he drove me in this morning.""), the conversation lacks depth in understanding or addressing how the illness or its symptoms impact the family dynamics, roles, and emotional health. Therefore, this interaction suggests a recognition of the support role of a family member but falls short of exploring the broader implications of the illness on the family."
SUPPORT SYSTEMS,3,"The interviewer does ask about the patient's support systems, specifically inquiring about the patient's husband as a main support system and how he was involved during the episode of pain the patient experienced. This is seen in the question, 'And you mentioned your husband earlier that you woke him up this morning. Can you tell me a little bit about your support systems?' and the follow-up regarding whether the pain was ever so bad that the patient considered going to the hospital, highlighting the husband's readiness to assist. However, the interviewer does not explore beyond the immediate emotional and some extent of logistical support from the husband, missing out on inquiring about broader emotional support systems, financial support mechanisms, or access to healthcare and other resources available to the patient and family. The conversation focused mainly on the specifics of the patient's condition and did not delve into the availability of community resources or additional support mechanisms outside of the patient's immediate circle. Therefore, the interviewer determines only some of the available support but does not fully explore or suggest additional resources that could aid the patient."
PATIENT’S EDUCATION & UNDERSTANDING,1,"In this conversation, the physician effectively gathers detailed information from the patient to understand the presenting symptoms and the patient's medical history. However, when evaluating the interaction based on the criteria for patient education and assessment of understanding, there is no evidence of any patient education efforts. The physician asks for detailed information regarding the patient's symptoms, medical history, and lifestyle but does not provide any information or education back to the patient regarding potential diagnoses, what the next steps might involve, or any form of reassurance or advice. Furthermore, the physician does not utilize techniques such as 'teach back' to verify the patient's understanding or offer any information that the patient could clarify or ask about. Although this part of the interaction focuses on gathering information rather than educating the patient, there is still a responsibility to initiate some form of patient education or at least lay the groundwork for it, which is not observed here."
ASSESS MOTIVATION FOR CHANGES,1,"The conversation primarily focuses on understanding the patient's medical issue and history. There are no direct inquiries about the patient's motivation for lifestyle or behavioral changes, nor discussions revolving around potential changes that the patient might need to make related to health habits beyond the screening questions about smoking, alcohol, and recreational drug use. The physician did ask about the patient's health habits as part of a routine history-taking process but did not probe into any readiness for change or offer any options or plans for lifestyle or behavioral changes. Since the core of the conversation was diagnostic rather than preventative or change-oriented, it lacks the elements necessary to assess or support the patient's motivation for lifestyle or behavioral changes."
ADMITTING LACK OF KNOWLEDGE,N/A,"In this conversation, the Physician consistently engages in a detailed inquiry about the patient's symptoms, health history, and lifestyle but does not exhibit any instances of admitting a lack of knowledge or seeking out additional resources to address unanswered questions. Moreover, there is no occasion where the Physician makes up answers. The conversation strictly follows the Physician gathering information necessary for diagnosis and does not touch on the Physician's knowledge limitations or their approach in such scenarios. Therefore, based on the provided criteria and the nature of this interaction, it's not applicable to assign a score relevant to admitting lack of knowledge or seeking accurate information, as these situations did not arise in the conversation."
INFORMED CONSENT FOR INVESTIGATIONS & PROCEDURES,1,"The physician inquired substantially about the patient's condition, symptoms, medical, family, and social history but did not discuss any investigations, procedures, or methods for managing the patient's condition. Specifically, there was no mention of potential diagnostic tests, treatments, or their associated risks, benefits, or alternatives. The conversation ended with the physician indicating the next steps would involve a physical exam and possibly some tests, but devoid of explaining what those might entail or discussing the reasons, benefits, or risks associated with them. Therefore, based on the criteria provided, there is no evidence of discussions about investigations or procedures, informed consent elements, risks, benefits, or alternatives in the excerpt."
ACHIEVE A SHARED PLAN,1,"The physician effectively gathered detailed history and established rapport but did not discuss the diagnosis, prognosis, or negotiate a plan within the provided conversation. No discussion or negotiation regarding the patient's condition or treatment plan was initiated. The physician mentioned proceeding with a physical exam and the potential need for tests, but no specifics were provided, nor was the patient invited to contribute thoughts, ideas, suggestions, or preferences. Therefore, the key elements of discussing diagnosis/prognosis and negotiating a plan with patient involvement are missing."
ENCOURAGEMENT OF QUESTIONS,1,"Throughout the conversation, the interviewer (Physician) does not explicitly encourage the patient to ask questions at any point. The Physician directs the flow of the interview by asking detailed questions about the patient's symptoms, history, and lifestyle without providing clear prompts for the patient to inquire further or discuss additional points. There were no opportunities explicitly given for questions to be asked at the end of major subsections or at the end of the interview. The interview ended with the Physician stating they would move on to the physical exam without asking if the patient had any questions or concerns. Based on these observations, the interviewer fails to provide the patient with the opportunity to ask questions or discuss additional points openly."
CLOSURE,1,"The interview does not provide a clear example of the interview's closure or detail regarding future plans for the patient, such as follow-up steps, further consultations, or any specific instructions for the patient to follow post-visit. Instead, the interview concludes with the physician stating they will 'do the physical exam, see if you need any tests, and then we'll move on from there.' This statement alone does not specify what the patient should expect after the exam or when any follow-up would occur, lacking details on the next steps or any immediate actions the patient should take. Therefore, the closure of this interview does not clearly specify future plans for both the interviewer and the patient, including what will be done, by whom, and when."

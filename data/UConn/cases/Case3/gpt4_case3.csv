,score,explanation
Opening,5.0,"In the opening of this conversation, the physician introduces herself by name ('Hi, I'm Brianna.') and clarifies her role ('I'm a medical student.'). She also inquires how to address the patient by asking, 'Nice to meet you, Dan. Is that how you'd like to be addressed today?' This introduction includes all three elements identified in the highest-scoring criteria: (1) introducing themselves, (2) clarifying their role, and (3) inquiring how to address the patient, using the patient's name. Therefore, this opening fulfills all criteria for a comprehensive and respectful introduction in a medical interview setting."
ELICITS SPECTRUM OF CONCERNS,3.0,"The interviewer does a thorough job in eliciting the patient's main concern but fails to explore beyond the immediate symptoms until later in the interview. The initial focus is on the chest pain, its characteristics, and what might worsen or alleviate it. Although the physician does eventually ask, 'Do you have any other symptoms besides the pain in your chest?' and explores various aspects of the patient's life, including medical history, lifestyle, and the accident during mountain biking which could provide crucial context to the chest pain, this broader exploration occurs well beyond the first 3-5 minutes. There was an opportunity to probe for additional concerns or symptoms related to the chief complaint during the initial discussion, which would have given a more holistic view of the patient's health from the start. Therefore, based on the scoring criteria, the interviewer elicits the patient’s main concern without probing for additional concerns within the first 3-5 minutes, so a score of 3 is most appropriate."
NEGOTIATES PRIORITIES & SETS AGENDA,3.0,"In this conversation, the interviewer, a medical student named Brianna, demonstrates a very focused and guided approach towards understanding the patient, Dan's, concerns and medical history. Brianna does an excellent job of eliciting detailed information about the chief complaint (chest pain) by asking open-ended and follow-up questions, which allows for a comprehensive understanding of the patient's symptoms, possible causative activities, and the impact on his daily life. She also takes the time to inquire about other potentially related symptoms, past medical history, family medical history, social history, and habits, creating a thorough background needed for a proper medical assessment. However, there's no explicit negotiation of priorities or setting an explicit agenda at the onset of the interview with the patient's agreement on what will be discussed or handled during the interview, as detailed in the scoring criteria. The conversation is more of a natural flow of question and answer to gather information rather than an explicit negotiation or agenda-setting process. Therefore, based on the criteria provided, while Brianna lists the patient's concerns and inquires deeply into them, she does not negotiate priorities with the patient or set an explicit agenda agreed upon with the patient at the beginning of their conversation."
ELICITING THE NARRATIVE THREAD or the ‘PATIENT’S STORY’,4.0,"The interviewer, Brianna, demonstrates a competent and structured approach to encourage the patient, Dan, to discuss his condition extensively, without dominating the conversation or veering off-topic significantly. Brianna begins by establishing a respectful rapport, asking Dan how he prefers to be addressed and if he is comfortable discussing his visit reasons. She conducts the conversation with focused, open-ended questions like, 'Alright, so tell me a little bit about what brought you to the office today.' and follows up with specific inquiries for clarification and detail, such as, 'Okay, and what makes it sharp?' and 'Okay, and you lift boxes at work?'. Throughout the dialogue, Brianna practices active listening, allowing Dan to share his narrative fully without interrupting. She only interjects to dive deeper into Dan’s symptoms, medication usage, activities, and health history, which helps build a comprehensive picture of his health concern. This method ensures that Dan's narrative is heard fully, reflecting a thoughtful balance between allowing patient-led dialogue and guiding the conversation to medically relevant areas. However, Brianna's several interjections for details prevent the interaction from achieving a complete narrative thread without prompts or questions. Therefore, the conversation scores a 4, as Brianna encourages Dan to share his story, though with slight guidance for medical relevance, rather than allowing for an uninterrupted narrative thread."
TIMELINE,5.0,"The interviewer, Brianna, effectively established a clear timeline and chronology of the patient, Dan's chief concern and history of the present illness. Initially, Brianna asked open-ended questions about what brought Dan to the office, then navigated through specifics like when the pain started, what exacerbates or alleviates it, and past medical and family history. She specifically inquired about the onset ('It started about two nights ago.'), characteristics of the pain ('Sometimes it's an ache, sometimes it's sharp.'), factors exacerbating and relieving the pain, and any associated activities or incidents ('I was doing that the night of when I first got the chest pain.'). This led to uncovering that the chest pain started after a mountain biking accident, thus establishing a possible causal relationship to his symptoms. This detailed history-taking allowed Brianna to piece together a chronological narrative of Dan's chest pain, including relevant lifestyle and recreational activities, providing a comprehensive understanding of the situation. Therefore, a score of 5 is assigned."
ORGANIZATION,5.0,"The conversation between the medical student Brianna and the patient Dan is well-organized and progresses logically through the patient's symptoms, risk factors, and history, ending with a relevant discussion about the patient's lifestyle that could impact his health. Starting with a polite introduction and seeking consent to proceed indicates a structured approach. Brianna moves from gathering information about the immediate concern ('Well, I'm having a pain in the left part of my chest') to inquiring about the duration ('It started about two nights ago.'), characteristics ('It's an aching pain and sometimes it gets sharp'), and factors affecting the pain ('What makes it sharp?'). Following this, there's a seamless transition into the patient’s medical and family history ('In terms of your past medical history, do you have any ongoing medical problems?'), and into his social history ('Can you tell me about your living situation?'). The discovery towards the end about the mountain biking incident that could be related to the chest pain is also handled with a natural progression ('You were mountain biking...and you drink on the weekend. Had you been drinking at the time when you were mountain biking?'). Each section of the interview builds upon the previous, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the patient’s condition without appearing disjointed at any point."
TRANSITIONAL STATEMENTS (only for complete histories),5.0,"The interviewer, Brianna, seamlessly guides the patient, Dan, through the conversation with clear, yet subtle, transitional statements. These transitions effectively delineate the sections of the history taking without confusing or overwhelming the patient. Notably, after discussing the nature and specifics of Dan's chest pain, she smoothly transitions to querying about any other symptoms by saying, 'Do you have any other symptoms besides the pain in your chest?' This pivot keeps the conversation on track while also expanding the scope of the assessment to potentially related health issues. Additionally, after summarizing Dan's main complaint and its specifics, she naturally segues into his past medical history with, 'In terms of your past medical history, do you have any ongoing medical problems?' Further, she uses the information gathered to transition into exploring Dan's family and social history by summarizing what had been discussed and then moving on with, 'Okay. So just to summarize your past medical history, it sounds like you're pretty healthy. [...] Okay. So in terms of your social history, we talked about your work. Can you tell me about your living situation?' Moreover, after discussing Dan’s social habits and recreational activities, she insightfully connects his chest pain to a recent incident by recalling, 'You like to mountain bike. Okay. Have you been mountain biking recently? [...] Oh, okay. So you hit your chest when you were mountain biking and your chest pain started after that.' Each of these instances shows Brianna providing context for the questions that follow, helping to make the conversation flow logically from one topic to the next. Therefore, the effective use of transitional statements throughout the interview is evident."
PACING OF INTERVIEW (not based on finishing on time),5.0,"Throughout the interview, the interviewer, Brianna, demonstrated excellent attentiveness to Dan's responses, allowing him to express his concerns and symptoms without interruption. Additionally, she used pauses effectively to let Dan complete his thoughts fully before moving on to the next question. An instance demonstrating her attentive approach is when she empathetically responds with 'Oh, I'm really sorry to hear about that' after Dan mentions his chest pain, indicating she is carefully listening and showing concern for his feelings. The smooth progression of the interview without awkward pauses signifies a comfortable and open dialogue between Brianna and Dan. She adeptly guides the conversation from understanding Dan's immediate health concerns to exploring his past medical history, lifestyle, and the details surrounding the onset of his symptoms. This comprehensive method not only helps in building a complete picture of the situation but also does so in a way that feels natural and unforced. There were no evident instances where Brianna interrupted Dan unnecessarily or where the flow of the conversation was hindered by unnecessary pauses. Therefore, based on the criteria provided, the interview merits a score of 5 for its attentive, uninterrupted flow and the effective use of silence, contributing to a comfortable and productive interaction."
QUESTIONING SKILLS – TYPES OF QUESTIONS,5.0,"The interviewer, in this case, begins each major line of questioning with an open-ended question, allowing the patient to provide detailed, narrative answers without leading them toward any particular response. For example, the initial approach starts with, ""Okay, so tell me a little bit about what brought you to the office today."" and ""Can you tell me a little bit about that?"" when inquiring about the patient's symptoms. These open-ended questions facilitate a conversation that uncovers important details naturally. Additionally, when shifting to other topics such as medication, lifestyle, and family history, the interviewer similarly employs open-ended questions like, ""Okay, do you have any other symptoms besides the pain in your chest?"", ""In terms of your past medical history, do you have any ongoing medical problems?"", and ""Can you tell me a little bit about that?"" regarding the family history of diabetes and heart problems. The interviewer adeptly avoids leading, why, or multiple questions, focusing instead on gathering comprehensive information in a structured yet conversational manner. Each significant line of questioning begins with an open invitation for the patient to describe their experience or situation, followed by more specific questions that help to clarify the details provided, such as ""Okay, how much Advil are you taking?"" and ""How much fish oil are you taking?"". These more specific questions follow the patient's responses, demonstrating an effective use of probing without leading or assuming. The sequence and appropriateness of the questions asked uphold the principles of good interviewing techniques, beginning with broader inquiries before narrowing down to specifics based on the information shared by the patient."
QUESTIONING SKILLS - SUMMARIZING,5.0,"The interviewer consistently summarizes the data obtained at the end of each major line of inquiry, verifying and clarifying the information with the patient. For instance, after discussing the patient's chest pain and its characteristics, the interviewer summarizes, 'So it sounds like you've had chest pain for two days now...' ensuring accuracy and understanding. Similarly, the interviewer effectively summarizes the patient's past medical history, 'So just to summarize your past medical history...' and later the social history and details related to the patient's lifestyle and incident that might have led to the chest pain, 'So it sounds like you...'. These summaries not only demonstrate understanding and verification of the information provided but also help in clarifying the details essential for diagnosis, aligning well with the criteria for a score of 5."
QUESTIONING SKILLS - DUPLICATION,5.0,"Throughout the conversation, the interviewer (a medical student in this context) demonstrates a careful and systematic approach to gathering information from the patient. Beginning with the chief complaint and progressing through the history of present illness, past medical history, family history, social history, and specific details pertaining to the incident leading up to the patient's current condition, the interviewer effectively gathers comprehensive information without unnecessary repetition. The interviewer demonstrates the use of summarization and clarification, particularly evident when confirming the details shared by the patient about his chest pain, its onset following a mountain biking incident, his Advil intake, and his lifestyle habits. There were no instances where the interviewer sought information that had already been provided without it being for the purpose of clarification or summarization. Therefore, according to the provided scoring system, this indicates a score of 5."
QUESTIONING SKILLS - LACK OF JARGON,5.0,"The interviewer, Brianna, communicates effectively throughout the conversation, utilizing language that is accessible and easily understood by the patient, Dan, without reliance on dense medical jargon. When discussing the nature of Dan's chest pain, the terminology used is simple ('aching pain', 'sharp', 'moves a little bit') and focused on the patient's experience rather than clinical diagnosis. Questions about Dan's medication intake ('how much Advil are you taking?', 'do you know what the dose is of the Advil?') are straightforward and avoid unnecessary complexity. Even when touching on more technical topics, such as the patient's past medical history and family medical history, the conversation remains clear and jargon-free ('you mentioned you have allergies', 'you take fish oil', 'your mom grew up with diabetes and she had some heart issues'). Brianna's approach ensures that the dialogue is within the patient's comprehension levels, making this an exemplary case of patient-friendly communication."
QUESTIONING SKILLS - VERIFICATION OF PATIENT INFORMATION (in vignette),5.0,"The interviewer, in this scenario, consistently demonstrates an effort to seek clarification, verification, and specificity about the patient's symptoms, circumstances surrounding the onset of symptoms, lifestyle, and medical history, reflecting a comprehensive approach to understanding the patient's situation. For instance, the interviewer asks about the nature of the pain ('Can you tell me a little bit about that?'), its triggers ('Oh, okay. And what makes it sharp?'), and specifics about the pain management ('Okay, how much Advil are you taking?'). These questions aim to specify the characteristics of the patient's complaint. Moreover, when learning about the patient's use of Advil, the interviewer probes for the dosage ('Okay, do you know what the dose is of the Advil?'), which reflects attention to detail important for assessing the patient's self-care measures. The interviewer also verifies the timeline ('It's been going on for how long now?') and changes in the symptom's intensity ('And is it getting better or worse over time?'). Additional verification and specificity are sought in the patient's medical history ('Do you have any ongoing medical problems?', 'Do you take any medicines on a daily basis?'), family history ('And how about your family history? Can you tell me a little bit about that?'), and lifestyle ('In terms of other recreational activities, what do you like to do in your free time?'). Lastly, upon learning of the patient's recent mountain biking accident, the interviewer clarifies the connection between this event and the onset of chest pain ('Oh, I see. Okay. So you hit your chest when you were mountain biking and your chest pain started after that.'). This in-depth inquiry and follow-up show a structured approach to gathering information, which is crucial for forming an accurate assessment."
INTERACTIVE TECHNIQUES,5.0,"Throughout the conversation, the interviewer, Brianna, demonstrates a high degree of patient-centered interviewing techniques, consistently encouraging Dan to share his concerns, describe his symptoms in detail, and express his feelings about the situation. She begins by establishing rapport ('Nice to meet you, Dan. Is that how you'd like to be addressed today?'), showing empathy ('Oh, I'm really sorry to hear about that.'), and gathering information in an open-ended manner ('tell me a little bit about what brought you to the office today.'). Brianna skillfully incorporates physician-centered techniques by asking for specifics when necessary to gather detailed information about the pain, its potential causes, and Dan's medical history, without compromising the patient-led narrative ('Okay, how much Advil are you taking?', 'Okay, and is it getting better or worse over time?'). The balance of patient and physician-centered approaches is maintained throughout the interaction without reverting to a purely physician-centered style or failing to accomplish a negotiated agenda. Brianna continuously redirects the lead back to Dan after gathering specific information needed for clinical assessment, ensuring a collaborative partnership approach."
VERBAL FACILITATION SKILLS,5.0,"The interviewer, throughout the conversation, consistently uses facilitative skills to engage the patient and draw out comprehensive information about the patient’s condition, history, and lifestyle. From the beginning, the interviewer establishes a respectful and open dialogue by asking, ""Is that how you'd like to be addressed today?"" This sets a tone of respect and attentiveness. When the patient mentions chest pain, the interviewer responds with empathy, ""Oh, I'm really sorry to hear about that,"" encouraging the patient to share more details about their symptoms. Questions like, ""Okay, and is there anything that makes the pain better?"" and, ""Okay, do you know what the dose is of the Advil?"" are probing but supportive, guiding the patient to provide more specific information without making them feel interrogated. The interviewer effectively summarizes the patient's statements to confirm understanding, ""So just to summarize your past medical history..."" and ""Okay. So it sounds like there's a possibility that your chest pain could be related to the mountain biking incident,"" which not only helps in ensuring accuracy but also shows the patient that they are being heard. Additionally, the interviewer uses the information shared by the patient to build on further questions and clarifications, which demonstrates active listening and encourages the patient to continue sharing pertinent information. Lastly, the interviewer provides reassurance towards the end by indicating they will discuss the case with a doctor, ""And I will talk with my doctor and you can wait here. I'll be back in a few minutes,"" which further reinforces their support and commitment to the patient's care. Therefore, based on these observations, the interviewer clearly demonstrates excellent use of verbal encouragement and facilitation skills throughout the conversation."
NON-VERBAL FACILITATION SKILLS,,"The transcript does not provide direct evidence of the interviewer's non-verbal communication skills, as it is purely text-based and lacks any descriptions of non-verbal cues such as eye contact, body language, facial expressions, or physical barriers. Without these details, it is impossible to accurately assess the interviewer's use of non-verbal communication to put the patient at ease and facilitate engagement. Therefore, based on the given information, a score cannot be assigned."
EMPATHY AND ACKNOWLEDGING PATIENT CUES,5.0,"Throughout the conversation, the interviewer, who identifies as a medical student named Brianna, consistently demonstrates empathy and uses supportive comments towards the patient, Dan. Brianna starts by ensuring the patient is comfortable with how they are addressed, which shows respect and establishes a rapport. When Dan expresses concern about his chest pain, Brianna responds with, 'Oh, I'm really sorry to hear about that,' which is an empathetic acknowledgment of his feelings. She further engages with Dan's concerns by asking detailed questions about his symptoms, their duration, and impact on his daily life, showing an effort to fully understand his situation. Brianna also exhibits empathy when she discusses Dan's family medical history, reacting with understanding to his mother's health issues. Additionally, when Dan reveals the chest pain started after a mountain biking accident, Brianna carefully considers this new information without judgment, despite Dan admitting to drinking while biking, and discusses how this might relate to his symptoms. Throughout the consultation, Brianna's approach aligns with the NURS (name, understand, respect, support) criteria for demonstrating empathy, by naming the patient's concerns, understanding his emotional and physical state, respecting his lifestyle, and supporting him through attentive listening and appropriate questioning. Therefore, based on the demonstration of empathy, supportive comments, and the application of the NURS technique, the interviewer should be scored a 5."
PATIENT’S PERSPECTIVE (BELIEFS; Case specific),3.0,"The interviewer did a thorough job gathering comprehensive information about the patient's chest pain, including the circumstances of its onset, its characteristics, and factors that worsen or alleviate it. However, while the interviewer extensively documented the patient's symptoms, medical history, family history, social habits, and circumstances surrounding the injury, direct elicitation of the patient's beliefs about the illness, such as feelings, ideas about the cause, expectation of the illness course, and their functional concerns directly associated with the FIFE model, was not evident in the discussion. The conversation heavily focused on clinical and lifestyle details without explicitly exploring the patient's personal understanding or beliefs regarding his chest pain. Therefore, while some aspects of the patient's perspective were indirectly addressed through discussion of symptoms and impact on function (e.g., concerns about going back to work and lifting boxes), explicit exploration of the patient's healing practices and perspectives on the illness were missing."
IMPACT OF ILLNESS ON PATIENT AND PATIENT’S SELF-IMAGE,1.0,"Throughout the interaction, the physician focused primarily on gathering a detailed history from the patient regarding his symptoms, lifestyle, and recent activities that could be linked to his chest pain. While the physician did a commendable job in understanding the physical aspects and potential causes of the patient's condition, there was a notable lack of exploration regarding the emotional or psychological impact the illness (or potential illness) might have on the patient's life and self-image. The physician did not inquire into how the patient feels about his situation, any worries beyond the immediate physical discomfort (such as concerns about his ability to work or participate in cherished activities like mountain biking), or how this health concern might be affecting his outlook or mental well-being. Furthermore, no counseling or resources were offered to address these potential concerns. The physician's close attention to the patient's descriptions and her empathetic demeanor suggest a level of care, but without specifically addressing the patient's feelings or providing support beyond the physical symptoms, the interaction falls short of fully exploring the illness's impact on the patient's life or self-image."
IMPACT OF ILLNESS ON FAMILY,1.0,"The interviewer, Brianna, fails to directly address the impact of the patient's illness or potential illness on their family. While she inquires about the patient's living situation, family, and support system, including asking if the patient could look to their girlfriend in a time of need, there is no exploration or acknowledgment of how the patient's chest pain might impact his family or his relationship. The discussion revolves primarily around the patient's symptoms, lifestyle, and how the chest pain affects his ability to work and partake in recreational activities. At no point does Brianna explore how the patient's condition might emotionally, physically, or financially impact his family members or require adjustments from them. Based on the given criteria, Brianna's handling of the situation fails to address the broader implications of the patient's health issue on his family."
SUPPORT SYSTEMS,3.0,"The interviewer made some effort to explore the patient's support systems by asking about his living situation, if he has family or friends in the area, and specifically about the potential support from his girlfriend ('So do you think that you could look to your girlfriend in a time of need for her to help you out if you were sick or anything like that?'). However, the interviewer did not directly address financial support or access to healthcare, nor did they explore or suggest any community resources that could provide additional support. While there was a minor exploration of emotional support through the patient's relationship with his girlfriend, other key areas of support systems like financial support and healthcare access were not covered."
PATIENT’S EDUCATION & UNDERSTANDING,1.0,"Based on the provided conversation, the interviewer (Physician) effectively gathers comprehensive information about the patient's condition, symptoms, lifestyle, and family history without explicitly addressing patient education goals or checking the patient's understanding of the situation. The Physician inquires deeply into the patient's symptoms, lifestyle, medication use, and family history but does not explicitly provide education about the potential condition or check the patient's understanding through techniques like teach back. Therefore, based on the scoring guidelines, the Physician clearly misses addressing patient education and correcting misunderstandings, which are crucial elements for a score of 5. Since there is no direct attempt to check understanding or educate the patient about potential causes of chest pain, or how lifestyle might impact their condition, a score of 2 would be too generous since at least some basic information was shared (i.e., gathering details that could be precursors to an educational conversation). There is no evidence of an attempt to correct misunderstandings or provide tailored education, as would be required for scores of 3 or higher."
ASSESS MOTIVATION FOR CHANGES,1.0,"The interviewer's dialogue with the patient does not directly address the patient's motivation for lifestyle or behavioral changes. Throughout the conversation, the focus is on gathering detailed information about the patient's symptoms, medical history, and the circumstances surrounding the onset of the chest pain. While this thorough assessment is vital for diagnosing the patient's condition, there is no specific inquiry into the patient's feelings towards making lifestyle or behavioral changes to improve their health. Moreover, the interviewer does not offer information appropriate to the patient's level of readiness for changes, such as counseling on the risks of mixing drinking with physical activities or the potential benefits of reducing alcohol consumption and avoiding smoking. Thus, the interviewer fails to assess the patient’s level of motivation to change and does not offer any options or plans or assume patient’s readiness for change."
ADMITTING LACK OF KNOWLEDGE,,"In this conversation, the interviewer (a medical student) does not encounter a situation where they explicitly admit to a lack of knowledge, nor do they make any attempts to fabricate information or seek external resources for answers within this exchange. The conversation revolves around collecting the patient's history and details about their symptoms, rather than addressing specific medical questions or advice that the student would not be equipped to handle. Therefore, this scenario does not directly apply to the scoring criteria provided as the interviewer neither admits a lack of knowledge nor seeks out additional resources, but also does not provide any false information to the patient. Given this, it is not appropriate to assign a score based on the provided criteria as the situation does not clearly match any of the described scenarios."
INFORMED CONSENT FOR INVESTIGATIONS & PROCEDURES,1.0,"In this conversation, while the medical student, Brianna, conducts a thorough medical, social, and personal history interview with the patient, Dan, there is no mention or discussion of any specific investigations or procedures that might be considered for Dan's chest pain. Brianna listens and collects information regarding the onset, nature, and possible causes of the pain, including Dan's activities and lifestyle factors that may contribute to his symptoms. However, Brianna does not discuss the purpose or nature of any potential investigations or procedures, nor does she review any foreseeable risks, benefits, alternative investigations, or the option of taking no action. Since the dialogue primarily revolves around gathering patient history and does not advance into the realms of diagnostic or treatment procedures that require informed consent, it fails to meet the criteria for discussing investigations or procedures."
ACHIEVE A SHARED PLAN,1.0,"The interviewer, in this case, did a thorough job of obtaining the history and understanding the patient's concerns and lifestyle. However, there was no part of the conversation where the interviewer either discussed a diagnosis or prognosis with the patient nor was there an attempt to negotiate a plan while involving the patient's input. The clinical assessment or management plan was deferred with 'I will talk with my doctor and you can wait here. I'll be back in a few minutes.' This shows the interaction ended with a promise of follow-up from the physician's side without directly involving the patient in decision-making or plan formulation based on the information gathered during the encounter. Hence, there's a lack of discussion on diagnosis, prognosis, and a mutual plan with the patient."
ENCOURAGEMENT OF QUESTIONS,2.0,"In this interaction, the interviewer (medical student Brianna) goes through various aspects of medical history gathering with the patient, Dan, including the history of present illness, past medical history, family history, social history, and specifics about the pain Dan is experiencing. However, at no point in this interaction does Brianna explicitly encourage Dan to ask questions at the end of a major subsection or at the end of the interview. Therefore, the interviewer does not give the patient an opportunity to bring up additional topics or points not covered. According to the provided scoring criteria, if there's no specific encouragement for questions, but the climate and the pace of the interview might indirectly allow them, a score of 2 is assigned. The dialogue provided does not indicate an explicit discouragement of patient questions, but also does not facilitate an opportunity for questions, fitting best with a score of 2."
CLOSURE,3.0,"The closure of this interview is inadequately executed, leading to a score of 3. Although the interviewer indicates an intention to consult with a doctor ('I will talk with my doctor and you can wait here. I'll be back in a few minutes.'), there is a partial detailing of the next steps, lacking specificity about what exactly will happen after the consultation, the patient's role moving forward, and when the next communication or appointment will occur. The statement implies an action plan (consultation) but does not explicitly outline the subsequent steps for both parties or provide a timeline."

CLOSURE = """
You will be given the transcript of a medical interview between a medical student (called physician) and a patient. Your task is to evaluate how well the student closes the interview. You will then provide your evaluation in a given JSON format.

To ensure a thorough evaluation, follow these steps:

**Step 1. Scoring:**
   - As you read the transcript, evaluate the medical studentâ€™s performance based on the criteria for each score level:
     - **Score 5:** At the end of the interview, the student clearly specifies the future plans: (1) What the student will do (leave and consult, make referrals), (2) What the patient will do (wait, make diet changes, go to Physical Therapy), and (3) When (the time of the next communication or appointment). 
     - **Score 4:** The student specifies most aspects of the future plans at the end of the interview, but may not cover all three areas (student actions, patient actions, and timing) as comprehensively as in a score of 5. The plans are mostly clear, but some details might be vague or omitted. The student shows a clear attempt to provide closure and future direction, even if not as thoroughly as in a top performance.
     - **Score 3:** At the end of the interview, the student partially details the plans for the future.
     - **Score 2:** The student makes limited attempts to specify future plans at the end of the interview. The information provided is vague or incomplete, leaving the patient with an unclear sense of what to expect. The student shows some awareness of the need for closure but struggles to provide a comprehensive plan or clear next steps.
     - **Score 1:** At the end of the interview, the student fails to specify the plans for the future and the patient leaves the interview without a sense of what to expect. There is no closure whatsoever. 

  **Step 2. Justification:** Based on your analysis in Step 1, assign a score using the provided rubric strictly, and explain your reasoning clearly. Your evaluation should be rigorous, impartial, and evidence-based. Directly quote the transcript to support your evaluation.

Provide your evaluation in the following JSON format. Provide your entire response in the JSON format and nothing else.

{
  "evaluation": {
    "score": 0,
    "justification": "A clear explanation of your scoring, with direct quotes from the transcript to support your evaluation"

# CLOSURE_OLD = """
# You will be given the transcript of a medical interview between a medical student (called physician) and a patient.
# You will be evaluating how effectively the physician concludes the interview, focusing on the clarity and completeness of future plans.
# To ensure a thorough evaluation, follow these steps:

# **1. Identify Key Elements:**
#    -  As you read the excerpt, create a list noting whether each element is present or absent:
#       - Specification of what the physician will do
#       - Specification of what the patient will do
#       - Clear timeline for next communication or appointment
#       - Summary of key points discussed
#       - Opportunity for final questions or concerns

# **2.  Self-Consistency Check:** Ensure your list from Step 1 aligns with the criteria for each score level:
#     - **Score 5:** Clear and complete specification of future plans for both physician and patient, with timeline
#     - **Score 4:** Good specification of future plans, may lack some detail or clarity
#     - **Score 3:** Partial detailing of future plans, some elements missing or unclear
#     - **Score 2:** Minimal closure, vague plans with little detail
#     - **Score 1:** No specification of future plans, lack of any meaningful closure

# **3.  Provide Justification:** Based on your analysis in Steps 1 and 2, assign a score and clearly explain your reasoning. Directly quote phrases from the excerpt to support your evaluation.

You will be given the transcript of a medical interview between a medical student (called physician) and a patient. Your task is to evaluate how well the student conducts the opening of this medical interview. You will then provide your evaluation in a given JSON format. 

To ensure a thorough evaluation, follow these steps:

  **Step 1. Identify Key Elements:**
    -  As you read the opening of the transcript, note whether the student:
      - Introduces self
      - Clarifies their role
      - Inquires how to address the patient
      - Uses patient’s name 

  **Step 2. Scoring:** Compare your findings from Step 1 to the following scoring criteria:
    - **Score 5:** All elements are present
    - **Score 4:** Student’s introduction is missing one element
    - **Score 3:** Student’s introduction is missing two elements
    - **Score 2:** Student's introduction is missing three or all four elements, and only a basic greeting (e.g. \"Hello\") is present.
    - **Score 1:** There is no introduction

  **Step 3. Justification:** Based on your analysis in Steps 1 and 2, assign a score using the provided rubric strictly, and explain your reasoning clearly. Your evaluation should be rigorous, impartial, and evidence-based. Directly quote the transcript to support your evaluation.

Provide your evaluation in the following JSON format. Provide your entire response in the JSON format and nothing else.

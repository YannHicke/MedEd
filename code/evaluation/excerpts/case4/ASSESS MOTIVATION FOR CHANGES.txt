Physician: "Well, from our standpoint, you know, six drinks in one sitting isn't really at the recommended level, especially since it makes you prone to make decisions like going mountain biking at night. So, you know, I might recommend that you try and drink fewer beers in one sitting. Does that sound like something you would consider?"
Patient: "I'll give it some thought because I am pretty scared about this potential injury to my heart. But I'd made the decision to mountain bike before I was drinking."
Physician: "I see."
Patient: "My friend Ben, he drinks way more than I do."
Physician: "Okay."
Patient: "But maybe with my mom's history I should, you know, reevaluate."
Physician: "Yeah. I mean, drinking is definitely one of those things that could impact your heart health, as are some other things like smoking. I'd be interested to know if you smoke any cigarettes."
Patient: "Occasionally, not. I don't consider myself a smoker, but sometimes when I drink I'll have a few."
Physician: "Okay. So smoking is another thing that if you feel like your heart health is a priority, that's something that you could change in your life. Do you think that's something you would consider?"
Patient: "Yeah, probably."

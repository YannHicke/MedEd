Physician: "Now, all of these things are things that exercise can help. Have you heard about the benefits that exercise has?"

Patient: "Not really."

Physician: "Well, exercise is very good for your heart health, for your lung health, pretty much total body health. Sometimes it can help out with weight loss, which then leads to additional benefits for your heart and the rest of your body, including your joints. So it might be important, especially important, if you have a family history of any of those things, to exercise in order to avoid your getting them. Does that make sense?"

Patient: "Yeah, it does."

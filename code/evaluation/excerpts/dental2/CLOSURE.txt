Physician: "So I'm just going to tell you what our overall plan is. What we're going to do is we'll, I think we have time now, we're going to do a complete periodontal exam on you."
Patient: "Okay."
Physician: "At that time, we'll be able to tell exactly how many visits you need to come in for."
Patient: "Mm-hmm. You're going to need one visit for a general cleaning."
Patient: "Okay."
Physician: "And then one visit for each quadrant that we decide you need a deep cleaning on."
Patient: "Okay."
Physician: "That can be between anywhere from one to four visits."
Patient: "Okay."
Physician: "So the most amount of visits that we're looking at is five."
Patient: "Mm-hmm."
Physician: "The least amount is one."
Patient: "Okay."
Physician: "But the number probably lies somewhere in between."
Patient: "Mm-hmm."
Physician: "So we'll be able to tell you that at the end of today's visit."
Patient: "Okay, excellent."
Physician: "Excellent. Do you have any other questions for me?"
Patient: "No."
Physician: "Okay, great. It was a pleasure to meet you."
Patient: "Yeah. Thank you very much."

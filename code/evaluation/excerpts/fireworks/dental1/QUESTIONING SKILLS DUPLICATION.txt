Physician: So you feel like you've had dental work in the past pretty much on a regular basis. Is that correct?

Patient: Mm-hmm.

Physician: And just you were in a car, and you're feeling like as soon as you had the new car, certain health problems were starting to happen. Is that correct?

Patient: That was kind of this, you know, it kind of snowballed from there. And I don't know if that, you know, was the official trigger.

Physician: Okay. 

Physician: So you think the problems with your teeth, you think they're related to chemical sensitivities? Is that my understanding?

Patient: Well, I had the mercury taken out. I had a lab report done. It was like a serum thing.

Physician: Okay. 

Physician: So you think it's just some chemical sensitivities to your teeth, and that's why you had the amalgam fillings removed then. Is that correct?

Patient: I wasn't sure if my body was rejecting the mercury or what was happening, but I figured it was a good idea to take them out. I had done some reading on my own, and then with the lab results, they said, you know, mercury wasn't good for me. So I figured I'd have them out.

These quotes show that the physician repeated questions seeking information that had already been provided by the patient, such as the patient's dental history and the reason for removing the amalgam fillings.

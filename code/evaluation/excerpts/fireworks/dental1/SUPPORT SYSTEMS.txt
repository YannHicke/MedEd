Physician: So do you have a little bit of family support then at home?

Patient: Well, she's 78, and the diabetes really affects her. So, I mean, it's more about her than it is about me at this point.

Physician: Okay. Yeah. All right. Let's see. What else? Make sure. ... So you just live with your mom who's a little bit disabled.

Patient: Yeah.

Physician: What about transportation? Is transportation going to be a problem or not?

Patient: Well, I can't take public transportation. I don't know what I'm going to be exposed to with that.

Physician: Okay.

Patient: So I have friends drive me.

Physician: Okay. So you would be able to come if a friend could drive you?

Patient: Yeah. My mom absolutely can't.

Physician: Okay. All right. And do you â€“ I know you used to mention you were a nurse. Do you work at all now or no?

Patient: No. No. I'm on permanent disability now.

Physician: Okay. So timeframes for the appointments wouldn't be too much of a problem then?

Patient: As long as I could get a ride, yeah.

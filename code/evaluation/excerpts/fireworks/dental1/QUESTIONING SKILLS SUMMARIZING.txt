Physician: So just so I've got an idea, you're feeling like you have some abscesses in your mouth and they are on both sides on the lower.

Patient: Yeah.

Physician: And it's been about 10 days, but you had some mercury fillings, some probably amalgam, are they silver-colored?

Patient: Yeah.

Physician: Silver-colored fillings in the past and you think that might be the cause and you had those removed about two years ago, is that correct?

Patient: About two years ago.

Physician: Okay. Alright. Just so I can get an idea.

Physician: So I think I have a good idea about medical history a little bit. So have you been seeing a physician on a regular basis?

Patient: Not exactly. Not exactly. I've had a few, you know, consulting doctors, nothing regular.

Physician: Okay.

Physician: I think I have a fairly good idea of medical history and dental history. So what we'll probably do now is take a look, if that's okay, to see what we can find, kind of diagnose the problem a little bit.

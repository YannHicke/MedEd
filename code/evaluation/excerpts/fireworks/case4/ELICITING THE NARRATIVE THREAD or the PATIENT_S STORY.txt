Physician: What brings you in today?

Patient: I'm concerned about a pain I have in my chest. And because of where it is, I'm worried it could be my heart.

Physician: Oh, okay. Is there anything else that brought you in today?

Patient: I'm just really concerned about my heart and then how it might impact my job as well.

Physician: Okay. So you're concerned about your chest pain. You're concerned about your heart. You're also concerned about your job. Okay. Is there anything else you'd like to talk about today before we move on?

Physician: So why don't you tell me about when your chest pain started.

Physician: All right. So tell me how it's been since that point.

Physician: Can you tell me about what the pain feels like to you?

Physician: So it sounds like your three main concerns today were your chest pain, that started a couple days ago, your heart health, because you're worried that you might be at risk for heart disease because of your mom, and then also your work.

Physician: Do you have any questions about what we've talked about?

Physician: Any other questions that you have?

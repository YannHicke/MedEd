Physician: Okay. So a couple of things that you mentioned that I want to make sure I understand, you're concerned about your chest pain, you're concerned about your heart, and you're also concerned about your job.

Patient: I'm just really concerned about my heart and then how it might impact my job as well.

Physician: And have you been to work since the accident?

Patient: No. Today was a day off. It happened on the weekend, and I'm scheduled to go back tomorrow.

Physician: Okay. Are you concerned about returning to work?

Patient: I am.

Physician: Okay. Once we finish up the visit and we do the exam and get a better idea of what's causing your pain, I would be more than happy to speak with my preceptor and see if we can get a work excuse for you so you can have some recovery time.

Physician: So it sounds like your three main concerns today were your chest pain, that started a couple days ago, your heart health, because you're worried that you might be at risk for heart disease because of your mom, and then also your work.

Physician: Well, I'm glad you came in.

Physician: That's good to hear. Okay. 

Physician: Good. Well, I'm glad to hear that you're wearing a helmet.

Physician: Great. Thank you.

Physician: Yeah. I mean, drinking is definitely one of those things that could impact your heart health, as are some other things like smoking.

Physician: That's good. All right. So it sounds like your three main concerns today were your chest pain, that started a couple days ago, your heart health, because you're worried that you might be at risk for heart disease because of your mom, and then also your work.

Physician: Okay. Well, I'll go talk with my preceptor, and you can wait here, change into a gown, and we'll be back in just a few minutes to do your physical exam.

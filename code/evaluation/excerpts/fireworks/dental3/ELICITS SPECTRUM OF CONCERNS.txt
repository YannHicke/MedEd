Physician: How's everything going for you?

Patient: Very well. Very well. You know, work is keeping me busy. A little stressful at times, but I'm hanging on. And I have great news. My wife and I are expecting our first baby in about four months.

Physician: That's fantastic. Congratulations.

Physician: Before Kathy comes in to do your prophy, I wanted to just update your history. Have you been having any problems since you were last here for your last visit?

Patient: Nothing major. You know, occasional bleeding of the gums when I brush and, you know, the usual tobacco stains on the teeth. And the flossing, I know you said to do it every day, but it slips my mind sometimes. It probably averages out to about three or four times a week.

Physician: Okay. And how often have you been brushing?

Patient: At least twice a day.

Physician: Oh, right. It sounds like you're doing a pretty good job, pretty reasonable job with your oral hygiene. We'll have to work on the flossing a little bit, but not bad. How about your general health? Have there been any changes in your health since you were last here?

Patient: Again, nothing major. A few weeks ago I had an episode of bronchitis, and with that came a little bit of shortness of breath. Like when I go running, you know, and when I run sometimes I get a little short of breath or if I take the stairs at work.

Physician: Okay. No other problems besides that?

Patient: No.

Physician: Have you seen your physician recently?

Patient: Not in at least a year, so I'll have to get on that.

Physician: Okay. Yeah, that's important, especially if you're having symptoms like shortness of breath.

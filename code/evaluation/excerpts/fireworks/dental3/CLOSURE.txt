Physician: Okay, all right, terrific. Dorothy should be in shortly to do your prophy, and maybe, hopefully, this will be the last time she's removing tobacco stains from your teeth.

Patient: Yeah, that would be great.

Physician: Okay. That would be great. Terrific. So then I'll see you at the end of the prophy visit to check your mouth.

Patient: Great, thank you so much. I really appreciate it.

Physician: Sounds good.

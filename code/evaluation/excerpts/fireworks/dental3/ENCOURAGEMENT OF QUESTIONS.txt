Physician: Any questions that you have at this point?

Patient: No. I mean, this is a new thing. Well, not that new, but I feel like I'm a lot more ready than I was last time. So this is good.

Physician: Okay, great. Well, if you do have any questions after you go through the material, please make sure to give me a call.

Physician: Unless I hear from you before then, if you have any questions. Sure, sure. As we talked about.

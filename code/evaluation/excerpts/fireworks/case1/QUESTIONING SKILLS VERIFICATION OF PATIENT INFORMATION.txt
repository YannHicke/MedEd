Physician: Can you start from the beginning and really tell me everything you can remember about when it started?
Physician: So it woke you up out of sleep. 
Physician: Can you tell me more about the pain? It was a tearing pain.
Physician: And where was it?
Physician: And did it move anywhere?
Physician: Okay. All right. So you tried to walk around. That didn't seem to help. 
Physician: Anything you did to try to help it?
Physician: Okay. So this was about 1 in the morning. 
Physician: What did you do then? What happened next?
Physician: Sounds like it was a long morning for you.
Physician: Okay. How long did the pain last?
Physician: Iâ€™m assuming you don't have it now.
Physician: Okay. Was there anything different about the urine that came out?
Physician: Okay. Is that something that you've seen before?
Physician: Okay. And while this was going on, while the pain was going on, was it constant? Did it come and go, or was it really constant for those hours?
Physician: Okay. Yeah. Any other symptoms that you felt at the same time?
Physician: Okay. And did those symptoms last throughout with the pain as well, or did they come and go?
Physician: Okay. Have you had any changes in your bowels?
Physician: Like diarrhea, constipation?
Physician: Okay. All right. And do you still get your menses?
Physician: Okay. And how long has it been since you got your period?
Physician: Okay. And did you have any vomiting?
Physician: Okay. And along with the sensation of having to pee and not being able to pee, was there any pain when you were able to pee?

Physician: Sometimes there's a correlation during your second trimester, which you're just starting, between gingivitis and pregnancy. So sometimes this gum disease is brought on by some hormonal changes that are going on in your body.

Physician: When you're pregnant, your body is producing hormones such as estrogen and progesterone in high levels. 

Physician: And when your mouth is not ideally clean, there's plaque on your teeth. In that plaque, there's bacteria. 

Physician: Sometimes the body's response against the bacteria with the hormones can be inflammation and can cause gingivitis. 

Physician: When you eliminate that plaque by brushing and flossing and having dental cleanings during your pregnancy, there will be no gingivitis. 

Physician: It is an infection being that there is bacteria involved and the body is kind of responding against that bacteria, but it's nothing that you need antibiotics for. It's something that can be taken care of with good oral hygiene, brushing twice a day, flossing once a day.

Physician: As I mentioned before, we need to get your oral hygiene. 

Physician: Good. Brushing twice a day, flossing at least once a day. Then we have to have you come in for a dental exam, periodontal exam, where we examine all the gum tissue in your mouth. And we see exactly what the problem is so we can make a proper diagnosis.

Physician: But it looks right now just to be gingivitis, which is basically inflammation of the gums. 

Physician: So I'm highly recommending that you have it done now, during your second trimester, which you're just entering into. Because, like I said, there is a relationship between having the gum disease and low birth weight and premature birth. There's a high association between the two. If we can take care of your oral hygiene situation, give you a full dental cleaning, come into the office, and we'll clean everything off your teeth, that's basically going to solve the problem, if it's done correctly.

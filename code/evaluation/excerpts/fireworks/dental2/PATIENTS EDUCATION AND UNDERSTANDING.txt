Physician: Okay. Sometimes there's a correlation during your second trimester, which you're just starting, between gingivitis and pregnancy. So sometimes this gum disease is brought on by some hormonal changes that are going on in your body.

Patient: I didn't know that anything about my pregnancy lead this bleeding. Can you explain a little slow?

Physician: Sure. No problem. When you're pregnant, your body is producing hormones such as estrogen and progesterone in high levels. 

Patient: Okay. 

Physician: And when your mouth is not ideally clean, there's plaque on your teeth. In that plaque, there's bacteria. 

Patient: Okay. 

Physician: Sometimes the body's response against the bacteria with the hormones can be inflammation and can cause gingivitis. 

Patient: Okay. 

Physician: When you eliminate that plaque by brushing and flossing and having dental cleanings during your pregnancy, there will be no gingivitis. 

Patient: Okay. 

Physician: And actually, if you do not take care of this and you have plaque and gingivitis during your pregnancy, there has been research that's shown that that can lead to early birth, preterm birth, and low birth weight.

Patient: Okay.

Physician: So there's pretty strong evidence to suggest there is a correlation between the two. 

...

Physician: But I think if we weigh the risks and benefits, I think it's less risky for the baby, with the research that we know about, to have some anesthetic if you need a deep cleaning, have some anesthetic put in your mouth, and have the cleaning done to decrease the amount of gingivitis in your mouth. Do you have any other concerns or problems with the treatment that we're going to be giving?

...

Physician: So do you understand everything that I'm telling you about? Could you just tell me what you think that I'm telling you, just so we're both on the same page?

Patient: Mm-hmm. Yeah, as long as you have a strong scientific evidence it's not going to affect the fetus, then, yeah, I think I'm going to consider to take maybe. 

Physician: Mm-hmm. 

Patient: Yeah.

Physician: Okay. 

Patient: My confidence level is reaching to the highest.

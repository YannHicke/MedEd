Physician: What brings you into the dental clinic today?

Patient: I have like bleeding in my gum, so I just wonder what happened.

Physician: Okay. Are you feeling any pain with that bleeding?

Patient: Not much, but a little sore when I brush my teeth.

Physician: Is that the only time that it happens when you're brushing your teeth or you're flossing?

Patient: During the day, sometimes sore, but mainly when I brush my teeth, sore and bleeding.

... 

Physician: Before we go into this any further, I'd like to know about your medical history. Do you have any significant medical problems right now?

Patient: No.

Physician: Nothing you know of? No history of diabetes, high blood pressure, cancer, anything like that?

Patient: No.

... 

Physician: So do you understand everything that I'm telling you about? Could you just tell me what you think that I'm telling you, just so we're both on the same page?

Patient: Mm-hmm. Yeah, as long as you have a strong scientific evidence it's not going to affect the fetus, then, yeah, I think I'm going to consider to take maybe.

Physician: Mm-hmm.

Patient: Yeah.

Physician: Okay.

Patient: My confidence level is reaching to the highest.

Physician: Excellent. Yeah. Generally, who do you consult with for your health decisions? Do you have someone, like, are you married? Do you have any family members other than your husband?

Patient: Usually I'm generally healthy, so not much to discuss with, but I live with my husband and parents-in-law.

Physician: So do you have any other questions for me today?

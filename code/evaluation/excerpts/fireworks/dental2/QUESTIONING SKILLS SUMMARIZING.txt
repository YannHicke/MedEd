Physician: So do you understand everything that I'm telling you about? Could you just tell me what you think that I'm telling you, just so we're both on the same page?

Patient: Mm-hmm. Yeah, as long as you have a strong scientific evidence it's not going to affect the fetus, then, yeah, I think I'm going to consider to take maybe.

Physician: Now, I just want to ask you, in the past have you or do you currently smoke or drink any alcoholic beverages?

Patient: No.

Physician: You do not at all? Okay. You haven't used any illicit drugs such as marijuana or cocaine?

Patient: No.

Physician: Anything else other than that?

Patient: No.

Physician: Okay, because sometimes those can be linked to gum disease as well.

Physician: But it looks like to me that a lot of this is from a preexisting condition that you had. You had some gum disease, and it looks like the pregnancy and the hormones that go along with pregnancy are kind of exacerbating the gum disease.

Physician: So do you have any other questions for me today?

Patient: I think you pretty much explained.

Physician: Okay.

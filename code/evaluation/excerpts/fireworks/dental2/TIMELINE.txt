Physician: How long is this bleeding, gums? How long have they been going on?

Patient: I think about a couple of weeks.

Physician: A couple of weeks? 

Patient: Mm-hmm.

Physician: Okay. Sometimes there's a correlation during your second trimester, which you're just starting, between gingivitis and pregnancy. 

Physician: Was that the last time that you went to the dentist?

Patient: No. I went to the dentist last year, too, but there's no episode of some disease. But I'm not sure for this year. I didn't go to a dental clinic yet.

Physician: Okay. So you had a cleaning about a year ago is what you're saying?

Patient: Yeah, a year and a half ago or something.

Physician: Okay. And how was your experience?

Patient: Just regular cleaning, not, like, deep cleaning or something.

Physician: And how did the deep cleaning work out for you? Did they see any improvement?

Patient: A couple of years ago, like, when doctor or the assistant applied the deep cleaning, I think it helps some soreness and then feel fresh.

Physician: Excellent. Yeah. Generally, who do you consult with for your health decisions?... ( conversation continues, showing interest in the patient's decision-making process and support system )

Physician: Absolutely. We can certainly take care of that for you. ( reassuring the patient that her concerns will be addressed )

Physician: Now, I just want to ask you, in the past have you or do you currently smoke or drink any alcoholic beverages?... ( conversation continues, showing concern for the patient's overall health and potential complicating factors )

Physician: Okay, because sometimes those can be linked to gum disease as well. ( educating the patient on potential risks and showing expertise )

Physician: But it looks like to me that a lot of this is from a preexisting condition that you had. You had some gum disease, and it looks like the pregnancy and the hormones that go along with pregnancy are kind of exacerbating the gum disease. ( explaining the diagnosis and showing understanding of the patient's condition )

Physician: So do you have any other questions for me today? ( inviting the patient to ask questions and showing willingness to address concerns )

Physician: Okay, great. It was a pleasure to meet you. ( ending the conversation on a positive note and showing appreciation for the patient's time )

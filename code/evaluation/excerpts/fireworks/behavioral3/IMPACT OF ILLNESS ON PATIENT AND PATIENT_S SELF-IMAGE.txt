Physician: And so now with your daughter gone, are you living with anyone?

Patient: No, no one lives. I just have our cat.

Physician: Okay. So the Zoloft is making you feel better, but when you are feeling kind of down, do you feel like you have a social support network?

Patient: Well, the guys I work with are really the guys who I know best, and we don't get together much after work occasionally. And I don't spend that much time with my father either. I'm really kind of a loner, I'd say.

Physician: And that would also be a really good way for you to meet people and to get more integrated into your community, since you said you're kind of lonely out in the rural Burlington area.

Patient: Yeah, I could try to do that. I don't generally go looking to make friends.

Physician: But you're looking into how to cook, so maybe that's just a default way to make friends.

Patient: That's a good idea. I like that.

Physician: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. (after patient mentions his mother's death)

Physician: That's great. That's really good. (after patient mentions the positive effects of taking Zoloft)

Physician: I can understand that. (after patient mentions not wanting to call his daughter at college to ask for recipes)

Physician: I'm glad. I'm glad. (after patient mentions feeling motivated to make changes)

Physician: Well, I'm glad. I'm really glad that you're motivated to take the first step in eating healthfully, and that'll be really good for you, I'm sure. (at the end of the conversation)

Physician: That's a good idea. I like that. (after patient mentions possibly making friends through a cooking class)

Physician: And that would also be a really good way for you to meet people and to get more integrated into your community, since you said you're kind of lonely out in the rural Burlington area. (suggesting ways for patient to address loneliness)

Physician: Okay. So you're here to talk about your eating habits and how to change them and make them better. Do you have any other concerns for today?

Patient: Not particularly, no.

Physician: Okay. Let me know if you do, if you remember anything as we're talking.

Physician: Do you have any other health concerns? Diabetes? No. High blood pressure? No. High cholesterol? Cancer?

Physician: Do you have any other concerns for us today?

Patient: No. You've got me thinking about all these new ideas about how I can make myself eat well, and I'm excited about it. That's really why I'm here.

Physician: But I really want you to feel like you can contact the office if you have any questions about nutrition or what you should be eating.

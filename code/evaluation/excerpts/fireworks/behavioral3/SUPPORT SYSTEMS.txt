Physician: So the Zoloft is making you feel better, but when you are feeling kind of down, do you feel like you have a social support network?

Patient: Well, the guys I work with are really the guys who I know best, and we don't get together much after work occasionally. And I don't spend that much time with my father either. I'm really kind of a loner, I'd say.

Physician: Okay. All right. Do you call your daughter once in a while at college?

Patient: I've spoken to her twice. She's called me. I don't feel like pestering her, and she sounds like she's having a good time, although it's just getting going.

Physician: And that would also be a really good way for you to meet people and to get more integrated into your community, since you said you're kind of lonely out in the rural Burlington area.

Patient: Yeah, I could try to do that. I don't generally go looking to make friends.

Physician: Right. 

Patient: But maybe I would. 

Physician: But you're looking into how to cook, so maybe that's just a default way to make friends.

Patient: That's a good idea. I like that. 

Physician: That's great. I'm glad.

Physician: You mentioned that you were financially stable. Did you say if you had insurance?

Patient: I do.

Physician: Okay, that's good. Because one of my suggestions would be to have you talk to a registered dietician.

Physician: And insurance should cover about five visits or even more, and he or she can give you a good basis of different foods that are good for you and how to change your eating habits to make it more healthy.

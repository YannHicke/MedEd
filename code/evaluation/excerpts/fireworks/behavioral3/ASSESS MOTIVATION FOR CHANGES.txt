Physician: So you're here to talk about how you can change that to make it a little bit more healthier for you.

Patient: That's exactly why I came.

Physician: Okay, good. So would you like to discuss making a change?

Patient: Please.

Physician: Okay, great. Absolutely. So I have a couple of ideas. You mentioned that you were financially stable. Did you say if you had insurance?

Patient: I do.

Physician: Okay, that's good. Because one of my suggestions would be to have you talk to a registered dietician.

Patient: Oh, okay.

Physician: And insurance should cover about five visits or even more, and he or she can give you a good basis of different foods that are good for you and how to change your eating habits to make it more healthy.

Patient: That sounds like a good idea.

Physician: So that's something you'd be willing to start up with?

Patient: I'd like to do that as soon as possible.

Physician: But I really want you to feel like you can contact the office if you have any questions about nutrition or what you should be eating.

Patient: Very good. Thank you.

Physician: And what I can do is go talk to Dr. Smith and come back. And I can bring in a contract for you to sign that just says that you'll be willing to start up this new nutritional movement for you to feel better about yourself.

Patient: Good. 

Physician: And you could sign that, and that could just make it more official, and you could feel more motivated to do it, too.

Patient: Very good. I'd be happy to sign that. I'm feeling pretty motivated. Great. This conversation is getting me excited.

Physician: Well, I'm glad. I'm really glad that you're motivated to take the first step in eating healthfully, and that'll be really good for you, I'm sure.

Patient: Good. Thank you.

Physician: So, I just wanted to start by figuring out why you're here today.

Patient: Well, I had an episode last night where I had really bad pain low in my belly.

Physician: Okay. Is there anything else that you want to make sure we address today before we talk more about that pain?

Patient: Well, I guess the other thing is every once in a while I feel like I'm leaking urine.

Physician: Okay. 

Physician: Is there anything else you can think of that you want to make sure we don't miss today?

Patient: No.

Physician: "That must have been scary."

Physician: "It sounds like it was pretty scary, so I think that we're going to be able to come to a conclusion about what this is and give you some strategies for avoiding it in the future."

Physician: "I think I have a pretty good picture of what happened."

Physician: "I feel like we've gotten a pretty good sense today of the different symptoms that you've been having and I understand that you've been having this really terrible pain and so I think we need to really figure out what's going on with that."

Physician: "Absolutely, absolutely. That makes perfect sense."

Physician: "Okay. All right, so I'm just going to give you a few minutes to change into your gown and I'll be right back. All right. Thank you very much. Nice to meet you."

Physician: Okay, all right. So, I just wanted to start by figuring out why you're here today.

Patient: Well, I had an episode last night where I had really bad pain low in my belly.

Physician: Okay. Is there anything else that you want to make sure we address today before we talk more about that pain?

Patient: Well, I guess the other thing is every once in a while I feel like I'm leaking urine.

Physician: Okay. 

Physician: Is there anything else you can think of that you want to make sure we don't miss today?

Patient: No.

Physician: Okay. Can you tell me a little bit more about the pain? Where it's located?

Patient: It was right down here. My right side.

Physician: Okay. Did it move anywhere?

Patient: It kind of. It started right there, but then it went down into my groin area.

Physician: Okay. All right. What kind of pain was it?

Patient: It was really bad. I would call it maybe tearing pain.

Physician: Okay. That must have been scary.

Patient: It was awful, yeah. Very frightening.

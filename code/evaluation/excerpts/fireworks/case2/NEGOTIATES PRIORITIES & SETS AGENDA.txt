Physician: Okay. Is there anything else that you want to make sure we address today before we talk more about that pain?

Patient: Well, I guess the other thing is every once in a while I feel like I'm leaking urine.

Physician: Okay. 

Patient: And I really want to talk about the pain last night.

Physician: Is there anything else you can think of that you want to make sure we don't miss today?

Patient: No.

Physician: Okay. All right. Well, it sounds like the pain is a little bit more urgent right now. So, we'll start with the pain. We may get a little bit of a chance to talk about the incontinence as well. You know, that's a common problem. And we can also set up an appointment in the future to talk more about that. Does that sound okay?

Patient: Yeah.

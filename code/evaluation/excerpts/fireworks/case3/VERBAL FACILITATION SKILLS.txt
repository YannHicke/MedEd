Physician: Okay, so I'd just like to summarize a little bit. So it sounds like you've had chest pain for two days now. Sometimes it's an ache, sometimes it's sharp. It's made worse if you're lifting things and you're worried because at work you lift boxes. It's made better by Advil. You said you've taken like two in the morning, two in the afternoon. That seems to help. You're not sure what the dose is on that. And it doesn't radiate anywhere. You have no other symptoms with that. Does that sound about right?

Physician: Okay. Well, that's understandable. 

Physician: Okay, so it sounds like there's a possibility that your chest pain could be related to the mountain biking incident. And I will talk with my doctor and you can wait here. I'll be back in a few minutes.

Physician: Okay, I'll see if I can do that for you.

Physician: Hi, I'm Brianna. I'm a medical student.

Patient: I'm Dan.

Physician: Nice to meet you, Dan. Is that how you'd like to be addressed today?

Patient: Please.

Physician: Okay, so I'd like to just talk with you for a little bit before the doctor comes in about what brings you in. Is that okay?

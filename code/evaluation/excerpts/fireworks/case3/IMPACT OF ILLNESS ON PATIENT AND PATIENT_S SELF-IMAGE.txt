Physician: Okay. Well, that's understandable. And in terms of other recreational activities, what do you like to do in your free time?

Patient: I like to mountain bike.

Physician: You like to mountain bike. Okay. Have you been mountain biking recently?

Patient: Yeah. Actually, I was doing that the night of when I first got the chest pain.

Physician: Oh, okay. So you're mountain biking and what happened with that with the chest pain?

Patient: Well, I was getting late and we wanted to do, I was at my friend Ben's house and we wanted to go down the mountain one more time before it got dark. So we were kind of rushed and I fell off towards the end, hit a bump that I didn't quite see, hit myself on the bike as I fell. I was okay. Sometimes that happens. But I was worried that the jolt because of where it hit me might've shaken up things in my chest a little bit.

Physician: Okay. So you mentioned you're gonna have to go back to work in a couple days and you do a lot of lifting for your job and you're worried if that's gonna interfere with that or if it's my heart, it might make it worse.

Patient: Yeah.

Physician: Okay, and you said lifting makes it worse.

Patient: Yeah.

Physician: Okay, do you think your boss would be okay with you taking some time off if you needed to?

Patient: Sure, if I get a doctor's note.

Physician: Okay, I'll see if I can do that for you.

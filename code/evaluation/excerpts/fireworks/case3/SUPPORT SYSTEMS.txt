Physician: Okay. So in terms of your social history, we talked about your work. You lift boxes. Can you tell me about your living situation?

Patient: Yeah. I live at home in a condo by myself.

Physician: Okay. And do you have any family or friends in the area?

Patient: My family lives about 45 minutes away.

Physician: Okay. And do you have any friends or significant other?

Patient: My girlfriend lives in town.

Physician: Okay. So do you think that you could look to your girlfriend in a time of need for her to help you out if you were sick or anything like that?

Patient: Yeah. I've been keeping her updated when she was over and helped me cook. So that stuff's okay. I'm just worried about when I go back to work.

Physician: Okay. Well, that's understandable. 

Physician: Okay, and do you think your boss would be okay with you taking some time off if you needed to?

Patient: Sure, if I get a doctor's note.

Physician: Okay, I'll see if I can do that for you.

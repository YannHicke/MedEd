Physician: Okay, so you mentioned a couple days. It's been going on for how long now?

Patient: It started about two nights ago.

Physician: Two nights ago. Okay, and is it getting better or worse over time?

Patient: It's about the same.

Physician: About the same. Okay, and you're gonna be going back to work tomorrow, you said?

Patient: Yeah.

Physician: Okay, so I'd just like to summarize a little bit. So it sounds like you've had chest pain for two days now. Sometimes it's an ache, sometimes it's sharp. It's made worse if you're lifting things and you're worried because at work you lift boxes. It's made better by Advil. You said you've taken like two in the morning, two in the afternoon. That seems to help. You're not sure what the dose is on that. And it doesn't radiate anywhere. You have no other symptoms with that. Does that sound about right?

Patient: Yeah.

Physician: So you're mountain biking and what happened with that with the chest pain?

Patient: Well, I was getting late and we wanted to do, I was at my friend Ben's house and we wanted to go down the mountain one more time before it got dark. So we were kind of rushed and I fell off towards the end, hit a bump that I didn't quite see, hit myself on the bike as I fell. I was okay. Sometimes that happens. But I was worried that the jolt because of where it hit me might've shaken up things in my chest a little bit.

Physician: Oh, I see. Okay. So you hit your chest when you were mountain biking and your chest pain started after that.

Patient: Yeah.

Physician: So it sounds like there's a possibility that your chest pain could be related to the mountain biking incident.

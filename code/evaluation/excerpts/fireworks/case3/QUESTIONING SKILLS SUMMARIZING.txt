Physician: So I'd just like to summarize a little bit. So it sounds like you've had chest pain for two days now. Sometimes it's an ache, sometimes it's sharp. It's made worse if you're lifting things and you're worried because at work you lift boxes. It's made better by Advil. You said you've taken like two in the morning, two in the afternoon. That seems to help. You're not sure what the dose is on that. And it doesn't radiate anywhere. You have no other symptoms with that. Does that sound about right?

Patient: Yeah.

Physician: So just to summarize your past medical history, it sounds like you're pretty healthy. You just have seasonal allergies in the fall. And you said you take Flonase for that?

Patient: Yep.

Physician: Yep. And then you said you've been taking fish oil for the past several years for heart health.

Patient: Mm-hmm.

Physician: And you haven't been hospitalized or anything like that. And your mom has diabetes for which she uses insulin.

Patient: Yep.

Physician: And she's had surgery on her heart valves in the past. Okay.

Physician: So it sounds like you, we already talked about your job and you lift boxes at work and your free time you like to mountain bike and you do drink about a six pack of beer on the weekends and you have been drinking and mountain biking at the same time. And this past weekend you were mountain biking when your chest pain started because you fell off your mountain bike.

Patient: Yes.

Physician: Okay. And you mentioned you also occasionally smoke cigarettes and you don't use any drugs. Is that correct?

Patient: That's true.

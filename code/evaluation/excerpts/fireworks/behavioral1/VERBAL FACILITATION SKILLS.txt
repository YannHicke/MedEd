Physician: "It sounds like you've been quite motivated to quit smoking, especially with your father's diagnosis. That's great motivation to have."

(not present in the conversation)

However, the physician does provide support and encouragement throughout the conversation:

Physician: "She's a good mom." (referring to the patient's mother who quit smoking and is supportive of the patient quitting)

Physician: "I think it'll be successful this time around. And then the other thing is that there are certain behaviors that you can actually change... So keeping your mind busy with other activities is really important."

Physician: "You have valid motivation, I mean, considering your father's history."

Physician: "We're in this with you 100%. So we're here to support you if you have any questions or anything."

Physician: "Sounds good. Any questions? Any other concerns?" (multiple times throughout the conversation, showing that the physician is open to addressing the patient's concerns and questions)

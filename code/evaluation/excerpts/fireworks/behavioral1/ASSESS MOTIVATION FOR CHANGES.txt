Physician: So what makes you think it's going to work this time around?

Patient: Well, that's the thing. I'm not sure, but my father got diagnosed with lung cancer, and he and my mother were able to stop. They tried a new treatment, so I want to try that as well.

Physician: Okay. So that's motivational to you in terms of your parents were able to do it, so hopefully you'll be able to follow suit with them.

Physician: You also want to make sure you tell your friends. So tell any friends that do smoke not to smoke around you if possible. Or if you need to, just try avoiding situations which you'll end up having being around the smell of smoke or being around people that are smoking.

Patient: Right.

Physician: Because it would be more tempted, and it will be harder for you. So do you think that would be possible to kind of just remove yourself from situations?

Patient: I'll definitely make every effort to do that because I really want to stop now.

Physician: Yeah. That's good. And you have valid motivation, I mean, considering your father's history.

Patient: Exactly.

Physician: So I think it'll be successful this time around.

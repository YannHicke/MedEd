Physician: So I'm just going to give you a brief on what things we'll go through today. So I'll start off by asking you questions about your current medical history, and then your past medical history, family history, social history. Get to know what you know about smoking and its effects on your body, and then we'll go through a plan. Does that sound like a good idea?

Patient: That sounds good.

Physician: Okay. So besides your concern about quitting smoking, do you have any other things that you would like to speak about today?

Patient: No. That was pretty much it.

Physician: All right. If anything comes up, you can just stop me or just remember for later. Sound good?

Patient: Okay.

Physician: Okay. So from everything that we've discussed, I just want to make sure that I've said things clearly and that I haven't misspoke. Would you be able to repeat back the plan that we've come up with?

Patient: Okay. So I'm picking a date, which is two weeks from today, to be my last day of smoking. And before that day, I'm going to try to remove anything that reminds me of smoking, you know, ashtrays and cigarettes and try to wash my sheets and clean up my car and things like that. 

Physician: Good. 

Patient: And we're going to try this drug, the Shantix, which I can get through Pfizer, so we have to do some paperwork for that. And also I'm going to tell my family and my friends that I'm going to try to quit smoking now and try to avoid friends who smoke at places where I normally smoke. And I'll sign a contract and have a calendar to remind me of my commitment.

Physician: Okay. Excellent. So just kind of do you have any questions in the end, or is this any other concerns?

Physician: So who really serves as your social support? Would you say it's your parents, or do you have friends in the area?

Patient: Well, it's mostly my parents since I'm at home. I don't really have that many friends in the area since most of my friends are out of state where I went to school.

Physician: Okay. And do you work currently, or do you stay at home, or what exactly do you do?

Patient: I've been working as a medical technician.

Physician: Okay. 

Patient: So that's all right. 

Physician: It keeps you busy, right?

Patient: Right.

Physician: Okay. Do you have insurance through your job?

Patient: No. That's the unfortunate part.

Physician: Okay. So later on when we discuss different treatment options to help you quit smoking, that's one thing we can discuss is your financial situation, and we can definitely take that into account.

Physician: Luckily, considering the financial hardships that you're facing right now, Pfizer actually has a program where they can actually sponsor the prescription for you. So they'll pay everything. They'll take into consideration your salary and the fact that you don't have insurance, and they'll pay for your prescription, and all you have to do is pick it up.

Physician: The other thing that patients sometimes are offered is the option to have a contract and a calendar. So what a calendar allows you to do is it allows you to keep a log of how you're doing, and you can also, like some patients, put stars on days. It makes them feel good about themselves, and it essentially tells us how you're doing with your attempt to quit smoking and what are your weaknesses. 

Physician: And it'll serve as your own personal motivation. Does that sound good?

Physician: We're in this with you 100%. So we're here to support you if you have any questions or anything.

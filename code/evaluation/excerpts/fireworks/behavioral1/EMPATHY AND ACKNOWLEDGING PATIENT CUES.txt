Here are the relevant parts of the conversation where the physician used supportive comments regarding the patient's emotions, demonstrated empathy, or lack thereof:

Physician: Sorry to hear about that. (in response to the patient's father being diagnosed with lung cancer)

Physician: So it's probably been tough on you in terms of your father's health history and also school. (acknowledging the patient's difficulties)

Physician: She's a good mom. (in response to the patient's mom being supportive of his quitting smoking)

Physician: You have valid motivation, I mean, considering your father's history. (acknowledging the patient's motivation to quit smoking)

Physician: We're in this with you 100%. So we're here to support you if you have any questions or anything. (offering support and encouragement)

These quotes demonstrate the physician's empathetic and supportive attitude towards the patient's emotions and concerns.

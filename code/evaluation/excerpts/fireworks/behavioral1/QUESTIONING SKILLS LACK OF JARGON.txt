Physician: So it sounds like you have a pretty good base of knowledge. Smoking can increase your risk of developing lung disease and lung cancer. It can also contribute to heart disease as well. Other things in terms of your appearance, it can actually discolor nails. It can affect hair. I don't think that will be a problem though. And it can also affect the teeth as well. So different effects all over.

Physician: What it does is it actually binds to the places where nicotine would bind in your brain, and it prevents nicotine from binding. So it kind of fulfills your cravings without you actually smoking.

Physician: You mentioned also the concern about weight gain. And I think the fact that you'll be, it sounds like you may be interested in increasing your exercise activity. Yes. So I think that'll actually help alleviate your worries about weight gain in terms of quitting smoking.

(Note: The physician generally avoids using overly technical medical jargon and explains concepts in simple terms, but there are no instances where the physician explicitly avoids using medical jargon and then explains it in simpler terms, as in the provided examples.)

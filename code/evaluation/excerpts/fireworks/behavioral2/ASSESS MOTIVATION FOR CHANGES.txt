Physician: So tell me why you want to start an exercise program.

Patient: Well, I've been tired for the last almost year. You know, it seems to be getting progressively worse, so I don't know if it'll help, but I'm hoping it will.

Physician: Let's see. Is there anything that you think would stop you from exercising? Anything that you're worried about?

Patient: Well, I'm kind of leery of going to a gym, although I guess they have the best facility. But since I have the problems and I just don't want to be in a bathing suit, I have horrendous varicose veins, which don't look too nice. So it's kind of making me â€“ I mean, I will do it probably, but it's going to be hard to get into.

Physician: Now, all of these things are things that exercise can help. Have you heard about the benefits that exercise has?

Patient: Not really.

Physician: Do you think you'd like to exercise with someone, or do you see yourself exercising by yourself?

Patient: No, I'd rather have company when I start.

Physician: How about we think about your starting a gym program and talking to your daughter, Lucy, and trying to get her involved in that with you. And seeing if your husband would want to do that, too. 

Physician: So at the gym, another benefit is that they often have personal trainers. And what they do is for a first visit at the gym, gyms usually give the new client, say, an hour or so with a personal trainer to walk them around the gym and show them how to use different machines. You said that you would be interested in trying out machines.

Physician: Would you like to start exercising as of a few days from now? Would you be ready for that?

Patient: Give me at least a week.

Physician: And then what we can do is we can get you back in here or to see the physical therapist within that week. And we can assess your back before you start that exercise program.

Physician: Is there anything that you think would stop you from exercising? Anything that you're worried about?

Patient: Well, I'm kind of leery of going to a gym, although I guess they have the best facility. But since I have the problems and I just don't want to be in a bathing suit, I have horrendous varicose veins, which don't look too nice. So it's kind of making me â€“ I mean, I will do it probably, but it's going to be hard to get into.

Physician: We'll keep that in mind, too, when we eventually talk about what exactly we should be doing.

Physician: Though you mentioned varicose veins. Do you think you'd be less worried about those if your daughter were with you?

Patient: Probably.

Physician: If you could put the bathing suit on.

Patient: Yes.

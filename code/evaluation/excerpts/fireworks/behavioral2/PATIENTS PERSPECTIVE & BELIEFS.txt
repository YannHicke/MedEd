Physician: So tell me why you want to start an exercise program.

Patient: Well, I've been tired for the last almost year. You know, it seems to be getting progressively worse, so I don't know if it'll help, but I'm hoping it will.

Physician: My guess is that it will. And is this something you discussed with your doctor six months ago?

Patient: No, I didn't.

Physician: Do you have any ideas as to what it might be?

Patient: Maybe lack of exercise.

Physician: Is there anything that you think would stop you from exercising? Anything that you're worried about?

Patient: Well, I'm kind of leery of going to a gym, although I guess they have the best facility. But since I have the problems and I just don't want to be in a bathing suit, I have horrendous varicose veins, which don't look too nice.

Physician: Sometimes stressors can have an effect on people's habits, like eating and exercise and all that.

Patient: Well, my biggest stress is my mom. She's still in the nursing home. She's been there 30 years.

Physician: Now, all of these things are things that exercise can help. Have you heard about the benefits that exercise has?

Patient: Not really.

Physician: Do you think you'd like to exercise with someone, or do you see yourself exercising by yourself?

Patient: No, I'd rather have company when I start.

Physician: Is there anyone else who lives nearby that you think would be willing to exercise with you?

Patient: Yeah, I kind of mentioned it to my daughter, Lucy, and she goes sporadically to a gym.

Physician: Do you think you'd be less worried about those if your daughter were with you?

Patient: Probably.

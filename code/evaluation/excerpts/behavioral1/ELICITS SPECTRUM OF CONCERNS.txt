Physician: "I understand you've come in today because you're interested in quitting smoking. Is that correct?"
Patient: "That's right."
Physician: "Okay. So besides your concern about quitting smoking, do you have any other things that you would like to speak about today?"
Patient: "No. That was pretty much it."
Physician: "All right. If anything comes up, you can just stop me or just remember for later. Sound good?"
Patient: "Okay."

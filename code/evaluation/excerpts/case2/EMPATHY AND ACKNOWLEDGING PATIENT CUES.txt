Physician: "That must have been scary."

Patient: "It was awful, yeah. Very frightening."

Physician: "Okay. That must have been scary."

Physician: "Okay, good. Well, I think I have a pretty good picture of what happened."

Physician: "Okay, so I feel like we've gotten a pretty good sense today of the different symptoms that you've been having and I understand that you've been having this really terrible pain and so I think we need to really figure out what's going on with that."

Physician: "Absolutely, absolutely. That makes perfect sense. It sounds like it was pretty scary, so I think that we're going to be able to come to a conclusion about what this is and give you some strategies for avoiding it in the future."

Physician: "Well, that might be something that we want to address too just to make sure that you're drinking enough to be healthy overall."

Physician: "Okay, good. Well, I think I have a pretty good picture of what happened. I just want to ask you some other questions about your medical history."

Physician: "Okay, all right. And have you had any pain with sexual intercourse?"

Physician: "Okay, so I feel like we've gotten a pretty good sense today of the different symptoms that you've been having and I understand that you've been having this really terrible pain and so I think we need to really figure out what's going on with that. And I also do want to address the incontinence a little bit later, but I think at this point it would be good for us to do physical exam, get some more information, and then after that we can talk and I'll tell you what I'm thinking about what what it might be and we can talk together about what our plan will be to go from here. Does that sound okay?"

Patient: "No, I just want to know if there's any, you know, what happened last night and if there's anything I could do so to prevent it from happening again."

Physician: "Absolutely, absolutely. That makes perfect sense. It sounds like it was pretty scary, so I think that we're going to be able to come to a conclusion about what this is and give you some strategies for avoiding it in the future."

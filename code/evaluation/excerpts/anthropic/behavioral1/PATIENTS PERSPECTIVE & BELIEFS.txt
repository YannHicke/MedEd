Patient: "Well, that's the thing. I was studying nursing, so I know a little bit about that."

Patient: "You know, obviously lung cancer and other lung diseases. And I think it can also cause heart problems."

Physician: "Okay. So it sounds like you have a pretty good base of knowledge. Smoking can increase your risk of developing lung disease and lung cancer. It can also contribute to heart disease as well. Other things in terms of your appearance, it can actually discolor nails. It can affect hair. I don't think that will be a problem though. And it can also affect the teeth as well. So different effects all over. Is there anything in particular that triggers you to start smoking?"

Patient: "For me now, it's mostly stress. It used to be when I was with other people, but now it's just mostly stress."

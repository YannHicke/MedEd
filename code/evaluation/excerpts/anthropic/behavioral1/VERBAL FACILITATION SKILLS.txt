Here are relevant quotes showing verbal encouragement and facilitation skills:

Physician: "Sorry to hear about that. I'm sure it has been difficult on you and your family."

Physician: "So that's motivational to you in terms of your parents were able to do it, so hopefully you'll be able to follow suit with them."

Physician: "Yeah, and I think the fact last two times you tried to quit were you went cold turkey. That is very difficult. It's very difficult to give up a habit that you've had for quite a number of years."

Physician: "That's good. And you have valid motivation, I mean, considering your father's history."

Physician: "So I think it'll be successful this time around."

Physician: "Seems like everything's kind of fitting into place."

Physician: "Yeah. Sounds good. Any questions? Any other concerns?"

Physician: "Okay. Excellent. So just kind of do you have any questions in the end, or is this any other concerns?"

Physician: "Okay. So we'll definitely follow up with you. And if you have any questions before the follow-up visit after about three weeks, then you can definitely come in or you can call. So don't feel afraid. We're in this with you 100%. So we're here to support you if you have any questions or anything."

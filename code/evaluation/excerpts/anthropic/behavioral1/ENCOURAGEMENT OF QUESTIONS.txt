The physician encouraged the patient to ask questions or raise concerns multiple times throughout the conversation. Here are the relevant quotes:

Physician: "If anything comes up, you can just stop me or just remember for later. Sound good?"

Physician: "Do you have any questions at this time or any other concerns you've thought of?"

Physician: "Do you have any questions or any other concerns?"

Physician: "Any questions? Any other concerns?"

Physician: "Okay. Excellent. So just kind of do you have any questions in the end, or is this any other concerns?"

Physician: "Okay. So we'll definitely follow up with you. And if you have any questions before the follow-up visit after about three weeks, then you can definitely come in or you can call. So don't feel afraid. We're in this with you 100%. So we're here to support you if you have any questions or anything."

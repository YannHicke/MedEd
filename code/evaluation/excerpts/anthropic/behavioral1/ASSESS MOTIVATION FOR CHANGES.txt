Here are the relevant quotes where the physician assessed the patient's motivation for lifestyle changes:

Physician: "So what makes you think it's going to work this time around?"

Patient: "Well, that's the thing. I'm not sure, but my father got diagnosed with lung cancer, and he and my mother were able to stop. They tried a new treatment, so I want to try that as well."

Physician: "Okay. So that's motivational to you in terms of your parents were able to do it, so hopefully you'll be able to follow suit with them."

Patient: "That's what I hope, yeah."

Physician: "Yeah. That's good. And you have valid motivation, I mean, considering your father's history."

Patient: "Exactly."

Patient: "I'll definitely make every effort to do that because I really want to stop now."

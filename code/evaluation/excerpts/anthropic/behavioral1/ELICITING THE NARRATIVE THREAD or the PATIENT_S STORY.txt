The physician encourages and lets the patient talk about their problem in several instances throughout the conversation. Here are relevant quotes:

Physician: "So besides your concern about quitting smoking, do you have any other things that you would like to speak about today?"
Patient: "No. That was pretty much it."
Physician: "All right. If anything comes up, you can just stop me or just remember for later. Sound good?"

Physician: "Okay. Is there a particular reason?"
Patient: "Well, mostly because of the smoking. And I don't get enough exercise, but it's mostly the smoking."

Physician: "Is there a particular reason?"
Patient: "Well, different reasons, but lately it's because my father was diagnosed with lung cancer and..."
Physician: "Sorry to hear about that."
Patient: "Right. So it's been difficult at home."
Physician: "I'm sure it has been difficult on you and your family. So you mentioned that you're taking vitamin D, and it's mostly to just help you with your mood. Is that correct?"

Physician: "Okay. Can I ask you how exactly that happened during your senior year?"
Patient: "Yeah. I just got distracted. I mean, I realized I was hanging with the wrong crowd."
Physician: "Okay."
Patient: "But I think by the time I realized it, it was a little too late, and I wasn't able to complete the year."
Physician: "Sorry about that. Have you considered going back to school or finishing up your education?"

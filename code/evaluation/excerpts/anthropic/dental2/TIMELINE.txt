Physician: "Okay. How long is this bleeding, gums? How long have they been going on?"

Patient: "I think about a couple of weeks."

Physician: "A couple of weeks?"

Patient: "Mm-hmm."

Physician: "Okay. Sometimes there's a correlation during your second trimester, which you're just starting, between gingivitis and pregnancy. So sometimes this gum disease is brought on by some hormonal changes that are going on in your body."

Here are relevant quotes where the physician avoided medical jargon and used language easily understood by the patient:

Physician: "Sometimes there's a correlation during your second trimester, which you're just starting, between gingivitis and pregnancy. So sometimes this gum disease is brought on by some hormonal changes that are going on in your body."

Patient: "I didn't know that anything about my pregnancy lead this bleeding. Can you explain a little slow?"

Physician: "Sure. No problem. When you're pregnant, your body is producing hormones such as estrogen and progesterone in high levels. And when your mouth is not ideally clean, there's plaque on your teeth. In that plaque, there's bacteria. Sometimes the body's response against the bacteria with the hormones can be inflammation and can cause gingivitis."

Physician: "It is an infection being that there is bacteria involved and the body is kind of responding against that bacteria, but it's nothing that you need antibiotics for. It's something that can be taken care of with good oral hygiene, brushing twice a day, flossing once a day."

Physician: "We can do it as it currently is without medication. As I mentioned before, we need to get your oral hygiene. Good. Brushing twice a day, flossing at least once a day. Then we have to have you come in for a dental exam, periodontal exam, where we examine all the gum tissue in your mouth. And we see exactly what the problem is so we can make a proper diagnosis."

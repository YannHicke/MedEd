Physician: So probably what the plan is going to be is that I'm going to ask you a few questions. They'll probably be dental-related and medical-related just so we can kind of get an idea of what's going on. And then we'll probably just do an exam, take a look in your mouth, and see what we can do and kind of make a plan for you. Does that sound good?

Patient : Sure.

Physician: Okay. Alright. So what brought you here today?

The physician sets a general agenda at the beginning of the conversation, outlining the plan to ask questions, conduct an exam, and make a treatment plan. However, they do not explicitly negotiate priorities with the patient or list out specific concerns to address.

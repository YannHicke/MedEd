Here are the relevant quotes demonstrating empathy and supportive comments from the physician:

Physician: "Yeah, we won't put anything in your mouth that you're not comfortable with first."

Physician: "No, I totally understand. We'll make sure that everything we do that you're comfortable with at first. We're not going to do, you know, anything that you're not comfortable with."

Physician: "All right. I will make sure. I'll have you look at the box first. I'll put them out here so you can see them. Does that sound all right?"

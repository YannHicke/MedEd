Physician: "Okay. Alright. So what brought you here today?"

Patient: "Well, I have a lot of soreness right here. I think it's abscessed. I'm not really sure."

Patient: "It's really painful."

Physician: "It's very painful. On both sides?"

Patient: "Both sides, yeah."

Physician: "On the lower? Okay. Can you describe the pain to me a little bit?"

Patient: "Right now it's throbbing."

Physician: "It's throbbing pain."

Patient: "It has been for a while, yeah."

Physician: "Okay. How long is the pain, like the duration of the pain?"

Patient: "Like how long have I had it or how long does it last?"

Physician: "Yeah, yeah. Kind of just describe a little bit to me."

Patient: "Probably, well, it's been on and off, but the way that it's been like this, it's been like about 10 days."

Physician: "It's been about 10 days?"

Patient: "Yeah. I didn't really want to do anything about it, but at this point I know I have to."

Physician: "Okay. Have you had any problems with it before this or it's just started at 10 days, 10 days ago?"

Patient: "Well, I had some mercury fillings that I had taken out about two years ago."

Patient: "And I don't know if it's related to that, but that might have, you know, started the ball rolling. I don't really know."

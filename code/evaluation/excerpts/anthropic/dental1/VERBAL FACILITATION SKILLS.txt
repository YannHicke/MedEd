Here are relevant quotes showing the physician using verbal encouragement and facilitation skills to engage the patient:

Physician: "Okay. Yeah, I will take a look at this later a little bit."

Physician: "Yeah, we won't put anything in your mouth that you're not comfortable with first. But we'll probably have to do just a little bit of research and a little bit of picking and choosing of what kind of materials that we would use if you needed a few more fillings done."

Physician: "Okay. We can try it out and see, and you may even find out that you don't need it."

Physician: "Yeah, so we'll try it out and see how it works. All right? And see how comfortable you are keeping it on, or you may even feel comfortable later on taking it off, but we'll see. All right?"

Physician: "No, I totally understand. We'll make sure that everything we do that you're comfortable with at first. We're not going to do, you know, anything that you're not comfortable with."

Physician: "All right. I will make sure. I'll have you look at the box first. I'll put them out here so you can see them. Does that sound all right?"

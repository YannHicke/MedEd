Here are relevant quotes regarding the organization of the interview:

Physician: "So probably what the plan is going to be is that I'm going to ask you a few questions. They'll probably be dental-related and medical-related just so we can kind of get an idea of what's going on. And then we'll probably just do an exam, take a look in your mouth, and see what we can do and kind of make a plan for you. Does that sound good?"

Physician: "Okay. All right. So what brought you here today?"

Physician: "Now, what about, I'm going to ask just a little bit more about your past dental history because I've kind of got an idea about your chief complaint right now. We'll address that first today, but I want to kind of get an overall picture."

Physician: "All right. So now I kind of have an idea of a little bit about your dental history. So I want to ask you a few questions about medical history because it seems like from your research you've kind of gotten an idea, too, that medical and dental history will be kind of related. It may be part to the problem. It may not. But I'll just ask you a few questions and take it from there. All right?"

Physician: "I think I have a fairly good idea of medical history and dental history. So what we'll probably do now is take a look, if that's okay, to see what we can find, kind of diagnose the problem a little bit. And we'll focus on those, you know, the problems on the lower teeth if that's, you know, really bothering you. And then we'll probably get a plan for you, kind of a treatment plan, that, you know, you will want to approve."

Here are relevant quotes where the physician sought clarification, verification, or specificity from the patient:

Physician: "It's very painful. On both sides?"

Physician: "Okay. How long is the pain, like the duration of the pain?"

Patient: "Like how long have I had it or how long does it last?"
Physician: "Yeah, yeah. Kind of just describe a little bit to me."

Physician: "Okay. Alright. So just so I've got an idea, you're feeling like you have some abscesses in your mouth and they are on both sides on the lower."

Physician: "Are you allergic to anesthetics?"
Patient: "I think so."
Physician: "Certain anesthetics? Okay. I'll ask you just a few more questions about that later."

Physician: "All right, and so do you think the problems with your teeth, you think they're related to chemical sensitivities? Is that my understanding?"

Physician: "Okay. Yeah, I will take a look at this later a little bit. So you think it's just some chemical sensitivities to your teeth, and that's why you had the amalgam fillings removed then. Is that correct?"

Physician: "Okay. And why do you have it?"

Physician: "Okay. All right. And did a doctor prescribe that for you?"

Physician: "Okay, but nothing has been diagnosed?"

Physician: "Okay. All right. Any, for example, any, like, heart problems?"
Patient: "As far as family history?"
Physician: "Yourself."

Physician: "Just the shortness of breath?"
Patient: "Yeah."
Physician: "Okay. Anything diagnosed of it?"

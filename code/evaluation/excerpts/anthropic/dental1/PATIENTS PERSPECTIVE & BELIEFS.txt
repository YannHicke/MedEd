Here are the relevant quotes where the physician elicits and addresses the patient's beliefs and perspective on their illness:

Physician: "All right, and so do you think the problems with your teeth, you think they're related to chemical sensitivities? Is that my understanding?"

Patient: "Well, I had the mercury taken out. I had a lab report done. It was like a serum thing."

Patient: "And I sent some samples out to Colorado, and that's actually the report right here."

Physician: "Oh, okay."

Patient: "If you can take a look later. It's pretty extensive, yeah."

Physician: "Okay. Yeah, I will take a look at this later a little bit. So you think it's just some chemical sensitivities to your teeth, and that's why you had the amalgam fillings removed then. Is that correct?"

Patient: "I wasn't sure if my body was rejecting the mercury or what was happening, but I figured it was a good idea to take them out. I had done some reading on my own, and then with the lab results, they said, you know, mercury wasn't good for me. So I figured I'd have them out."

Physician: "Okay. Well, I mean, there have been some studies done, and the American Dental Association has said that amalgam fillings that have the mercury in it are safe to use. But, however, there are some other materials that we could use. There's some resins and certain other types of materials that we could try. And I'll take a look at this and see if we can find something that you'd be comfortable with that we could try that might be not as sensitive."

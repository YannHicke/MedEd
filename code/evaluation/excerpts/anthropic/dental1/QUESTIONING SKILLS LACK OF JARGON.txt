Here are relevant quotes showing the physician avoiding medical jargon and using easily understood language:

Physician: "Gastroesophageal reflux disease is what you might know as acid reflux, and dyspepsia is just another word for indigestion."

Physician: "Well, I mean, there have been some studies done, and the American Dental Association has said that amalgam fillings that have the mercury in it are safe to use. But, however, there are some other materials that we could use. There's some resins and certain other types of materials that we could try."

Physician: "Yeah, we won't put anything in your mouth that you're not comfortable with first. But we'll probably have to do just a little bit of research and a little bit of picking and choosing of what kind of materials that we would use if you needed a few more fillings done."

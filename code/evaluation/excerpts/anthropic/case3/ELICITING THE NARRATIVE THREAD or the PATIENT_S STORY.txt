Here are the relevant quotes showing the physician encouraging and letting the patient talk about their problem:

Physician: "Okay, so I'd like to just talk with you for a little bit before the doctor comes in about what brings you in. Is that okay?"

Patient: "Sure."

Physician: "All right, so tell me a little bit about what brought you to the office today."

Patient: "Well, I'm having a pain in the left part of my chest and I'm worried it could be my heart."

Physician: "Oh, I'm really sorry to hear about that. Can you tell me a little bit about that?"

Patient: "Sure. It's an aching pain and sometimes it gets sharp and it moves a little bit and I hear that can be heart pain."

Physician: "Oh, okay. And what makes it sharp?"

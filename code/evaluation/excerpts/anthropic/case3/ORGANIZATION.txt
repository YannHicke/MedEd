Here are the relevant quotes regarding the organization of the interview:

Physician: "Okay, so I'd like to just talk with you for a little bit before the doctor comes in about what brings you in. Is that okay?"

Patient: "Sure."

Physician: "All right, so tell me a little bit about what brought you to the office today."

Physician: "So I'd just like to summarize a little bit. So it sounds like you've had chest pain for two days now. Sometimes it's an ache, sometimes it's sharp. It's made worse if you're lifting things and you're worried because at work you lift boxes. It's made better by Advil. You said you've taken like two in the morning, two in the afternoon. That seems to help. You're not sure what the dose is on that. And it doesn't radiate anywhere. You have no other symptoms with that. Does that sound about right?"

Patient: "Yeah."

Physician: "Okay. In terms of your past medical history, do you have any ongoing medical problems?"

Physician: "So just to summarize your past medical history, it sounds like you're pretty healthy. You just have seasonal allergies in the fall. And you said you take Flonase for that?"

Physician: "So in terms of your social history, we talked about your work. You lift boxes. Can you tell me about your living situation?"

Physician: "So it sounds like you, we already talked about your job and you lift boxes at work and your free time you like to mountain bike and you do drink about a six pack of beer on the weekends and you have been drinking and mountain biking at the same time. And this past weekend you were mountain biking when your chest pain started because you fell off your mountain bike."

Physician: "Okay. So it sounds like there's a possibility that your chest pain could be related to the mountain biking incident. And I will talk with my doctor and you can wait here. I'll be back in a few minutes."

Physician: So what brings you in today?
Patient: Well, I had an episode last night where I had really bad pain, low down in my belly.
Physician: Can you start from the beginning and really tell me everything you can remember about when it started?
Patient: Sure. It woke me up last night a little after, I'd say about 1 o'clock. And it was an awful, I don't know, I want to say like tearing pain. So I got up. I kind of walked around. Woke up my husband. And, I don't know, it just didn't get any better. It was awful.
Physician: So it woke you up out of sleep. 
Patient: Right. 
Physician: Can you tell me more about the pain? It was a tearing pain.
Patient: Yeah. I think it's one of the worst pains I've had in my life.
Physician: And where was it?
Patient: Down low on my right side of my abdomen.
Physician: And did it move anywhere?
Patient: Yeah, sometimes it would move down into my groin area.

Physician: Okay. I just want to move on now and ask you some more questions about your health. 
Patient: Okay

Physician: All right. I just want to ask you now about your family history.
Patient: Okay. 

Physician: Okay. So I'm just going to move on now and ask you some questions about your daily life and some of your health habits.
Patient: Okay.

Physician: Okay. All right. I'm glad you have that support in your life. In terms of the history, I feel like we've gotten a pretty good idea of what's going on and the symptoms that you've had. So at this point, I think we just need to do the physical exam, see if you need any tests, and then we'll move on from there.
Patient: Okay.

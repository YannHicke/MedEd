Physician: "Okay. Well, that's good. I'm glad. And you mentioned your husband earlier that you woke him up this morning. Can you tell me a little bit about your support systems?"

Patient: "I guess he's probably the main support system. I mean, he was helpful last night or was trying to be. Yeah. And he drove me in this morning."

Physician: "Okay. Okay. Last night when you had this pain, was it ever so bad that you thought about going to the hospital?"

Patient: "You know, my husband said, you know, why don't we go to the hospital? And then I'd be like, okay, let's go. And then I'd be like, no, I have to go to the bathroom. And then I'd be, you know, sitting in the bathroom. And then the pain was so bad. And then I'd have to pee again. And I never really kind of made it. And then the pain went away."

Physician: "Okay. So you never made it, but if you had really needed to go, he would have been able to help you. Take you."

Patient: "Oh, yeah."

Physician: "Okay. All right. I'm glad you have that support in your life."

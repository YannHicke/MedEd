"So what brings you in today?"

"Can you start from the beginning and really tell me everything you can remember about when it started?"

"Can you tell me more about the pain? It was a tearing pain."

"And where was it?"

"And did it move anywhere?"

"Anything you did to try to help it?"

"What did you do then? What happened next?"

"Okay. How long did the pain last?"

"Was there anything different about the urine that came out?"

"Is that something that you've seen before?"

"And while this was going on, while the pain was going on, was it constant? Did it come and go, or was it really constant for those hours?"

"Any other symptoms that you felt at the same time?"

"And did those symptoms last throughout with the pain as well, or did they come and go?"

"Have you had any changes in your bowels?"

"Like diarrhea, constipation?"

"And do you still get your menses?"

"And how long has it been since you got your period?"

"And did you have any vomiting?"

"And along with the sensation of having to pee and not being able to pee, was there any pain when you were able to pee?"

"How would you describe your overall health?"

"Do you see a doctor regularly?"

"Who is the doctor?"

"Does she treat you for any medical conditions?"

"Have you been in the hospital ever?"

"And any surgeries that you've had?"

"Just want to ask you also if there are any medicines that you take."

"Any allergies that you have?"

"Are there any diseases that run in your family?"

"Anybody in your family that you know of ever have kidney problems?"

"Kidney stones?"

"Do you drink alcohol?"

"And no smoking?"

"And you don't do any other kinds of recreational drugs?"

"And what do you do for a living?"

"So are you missing work today?"

"Is that going to be a problem?"

"Can you tell me a little bit about your support systems?"

"Last night when you had this pain, was it ever so bad that you thought about going to the hospital?"

Here are the relevant quotes where the physician negotiates priorities and sets the agenda:

Physician: "Okay. Is there anything else that you want to make sure we address today before we talk more about that pain?"

Patient: "Well, I guess the other thing is every once in a while I feel like I'm leaking urine."

Physician: "Okay."

Patient: "And I really want to talk about the pain last night."

Physician: "Okay. All right. Well, it sounds like the pain is a little bit more urgent right now. So, we'll start with the pain. We may get a little bit of a chance to talk about the incontinence as well. You know, that's a common problem. And we can also set up an appointment in the future to talk more about that. Does that sound okay?"

Patient: "Yeah."

Physician: "Okay, so I feel like we've gotten a pretty good sense today of the different symptoms that you've been having and I understand that you've been having this really terrible pain and so I think we need to really figure out what's going on with that. And I also do want to address the incontinence a little bit later, but I think at this point it would be good for us to do physical exam, get some more information, and then after that we can talk and I'll tell you what I'm thinking about what what it might be and we can talk together about what our plan will be to go from here. Does that sound okay?"

Patient: "Sounds great."

Here are relevant quotes showing the physician using verbal encouragement and facilitation skills to engage the patient:

Physician: "Okay. That must have been scary."

Physician: "Okay. Well, that's kind of a lot. How come so many?"

Physician: "Okay. So more of a preventive sort of thing?"

Physician: "Okay. So I just want to kind of summarize what you've told me so far since I jumped around a little bit and make sure that I got everything right. If anything's wrong, let me know for sure, or if we forgot anything."

Physician: "Okay. Does that sound like a reasonable summary? Anything I missed?"

Physician: "Absolutely, absolutely. That makes perfect sense. It sounds like it was pretty scary, so I think that we're going to be able to come to a conclusion about what this is and give you some strategies for avoiding it in the future."

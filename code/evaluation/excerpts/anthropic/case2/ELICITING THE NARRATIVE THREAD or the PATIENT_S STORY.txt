Physician: "Okay, all right. So, I just wanted to start by figuring out why you're here today."

Patient: "Well, I had an episode last night where I had really bad pain low in my belly."

Physician: "Okay. Is there anything else that you want to make sure we address today before we talk more about that pain?"

Patient: "Well, I guess the other thing is every once in a while I feel like I'm leaking urine."

Physician: "Okay." 

Patient: "And I really want to talk about the pain last night."

Physician: "Okay. All right. Well, it sounds like the pain is a little bit more urgent right now. So, we'll start with the pain. We may get a little bit of a chance to talk about the incontinence as well. You know, that's a common problem. And we can also set up an appointment in the future to talk more about that. Does that sound okay?"

Patient: "Yeah."

Physician: "Okay. Can you tell me a little bit more about the pain? Where it's located?"

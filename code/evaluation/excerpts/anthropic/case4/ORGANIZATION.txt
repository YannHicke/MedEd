Physician: "Okay. So you're concerned about your chest pain. You're concerned about your heart. You're also concerned about your job. Okay. Is there anything else you'd like to talk about today before we move on?"

Patient: "No, that's it."

Physician: "Okay. So I'll just ask a little bit about your chest pain, and then we'll get some information that will help me assess your risk of heart disease since it sounds like you're concerned about that, and then we'll find out a little bit about your job. Okay. Is that okay?"

Patient: "Sure."

Physician: "So it sounds like your three main concerns today were your chest pain, that started a couple days ago, your heart health, because you're worried that you might be at risk for heart disease because of your mom, and then also your work. So it sounds like your chest pain is probably related to the mountain biking accident, and we talked about getting you a note for work. And based on what I've heard from your history, it sounds like at your age and with the lifestyle you have, you're not at a terrible risk for heart disease at this time, but making some changes with cutting out alcohol and smoking, I think that that would definitely decrease your risks of heart disease in the future. Do you have any questions about what we've talked about?"

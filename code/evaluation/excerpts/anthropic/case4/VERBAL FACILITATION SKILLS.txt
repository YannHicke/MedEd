Here are relevant quotes showing the physician using verbal encouragement and facilitation skills to engage the patient:

Physician: "Well, I'm glad you came in."

Physician: "Good. Well, I'm glad to hear that you're wearing a helmet."

Physician: "Okay. And you said the sharpness comes on when you move."

Physician: "Okay. Does that sound okay?"

Physician: "Good. All right. So a couple more questions about your social history."

Physician: "Okay. So smoking is another thing that if you feel like your heart health is a priority, that's something that you could change in your life. Do you think that's something you would consider?"

Physician: "That's good."

Physician: "Do you have any questions about what we've talked about?"

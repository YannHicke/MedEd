Here are the relevant quotes where the physician encourages and lets the patient talk about their problem:

Physician: "What brings you in today?"

Patient: "I'm concerned about a pain I have in my chest. And because of where it is, I'm worried it could be my heart."

Physician: "Oh, okay. Is there anything else that brought you in today?"

Patient: "I'm just really concerned about my heart and then how it might impact my job as well."

Physician: "Okay. So you're concerned about your chest pain. You're concerned about your heart. You're also concerned about your job. Okay. Is there anything else you'd like to talk about today before we move on?"

Patient: "No, that's it."

Physician: "Okay. So I'll just ask a little bit about your chest pain, and then we'll get some information that will help me assess your risk of heart disease since it sounds like you're concerned about that, and then we'll find out a little bit about your job. Okay. Is that okay?"

Patient: "Sure."

Physician: "All right. So why don't you tell me about when your chest pain started."

Patient: "About two nights ago, I noticed the pain, and I thought it might have just went away on its own, but it hasn't, so I'm getting more nervous about it."

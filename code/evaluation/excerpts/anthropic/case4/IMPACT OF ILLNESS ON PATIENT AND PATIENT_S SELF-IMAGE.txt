Physician: "So moving on to your past medical history, can you tell me about any ongoing medical problems that you might have?"
Patient: "I'm pretty healthy otherwise. I have seasonal allergies."

Physician: "Okay. And in terms of your social history, can you tell me a little bit about your work? You mentioned you're concerned how this might impact your ability to go to work."
Patient: "Sure. I stock shelves, and I feel like, you know, the pain is tolerable if it was low, but over my head it hurts, and even more so than the pain. You know, if I'm having a heart issue, I don't want to do something that kind of pushes me over the edge and makes it worse."

Physician: "Okay. Are you concerned about returning to work?"
Patient: "I am."

Physician: "Yeah. I mean, drinking is definitely one of those things that could impact your heart health, as are some other things like smoking. I'd be interested to know if you smoke any cigarettes."
Patient: "Occasionally, not. I don't consider myself a smoker, but sometimes when I drink I'll have a few."

Physician: "Okay. So smoking is another thing that if you feel like your heart health is a priority, that's something that you could change in your life. Do you think that's something you would consider?"
Patient: "Yeah, probably."

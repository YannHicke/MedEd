Physician: "Okay. So the Zoloft is making you feel better, but when you are feeling kind of down, do you feel like you have a social support network?"

Patient: "Well, the guys I work with are really the guys who I know best, and we don't get together much after work occasionally. And I don't spend that much time with my father either. I'm really kind of a loner, I'd say."

Physician: "Okay. All right. Do you call your daughter once in a while at college?"

Patient: "I've spoken to her twice. She's called me. I don't feel like pestering her, and she sounds like she's having a good time, although it's just getting going."

Physician: "And that would also be a really good way for you to meet people and to get more integrated into your community, since you said you're kind of lonely out in the rural Burlington area."

Patient: "Yeah, I could try to do that. I don't generally go looking to make friends."

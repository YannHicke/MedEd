Physician: "So you're here to talk about your eating habits and how to change them and make them better. Do you have any other concerns for today?"

Patient: "Not particularly, no."

Physician: "Okay. Let me know if you do, if you remember anything as we're talking."

Physician: "Okay, good. So would you like to discuss making a change?"

Patient: "Please."

Physician: "Okay, great. Absolutely. So I have a couple of ideas. You mentioned that you were financially stable. Did you say if you had insurance?"

Patient: "I do."

Physician: "Okay, that's good. Because one of my suggestions would be to have you talk to a registered dietician."

Patient: "Oh, okay."

Physician: "And insurance should cover about five visits or even more, and he or she can give you a good basis of different foods that are good for you and how to change your eating habits to make it more healthy."

Patient: "That sounds like a good idea."

Physician: "So that's something you'd be willing to start up with?"

Patient: "I'd like to do that as soon as possible."

Physician: "Okay, that's great. Good. So we could, after this, we could make an appointment with a dietician that you can go talk to about that."

Physician: "Okay. So we'll establish the appointment for the dietician."

Patient: "Okay."

Physician: "And this is something that I'd like to work with you together. We could make the appointment together. And then we can also have you make an appointment to see me and Dr. Smith in two weeks to see how, if you had the first appointment, how that went."

Patient: "Okay."

Physician: "And also talk about maybe you've already enrolled in the class and how that's coming along."

Patient: "Excellent."

Physician: "But I really want you to feel like you can contact the office if you have any questions about nutrition or what you should be eating."

Patient: "Very good. Thank you."

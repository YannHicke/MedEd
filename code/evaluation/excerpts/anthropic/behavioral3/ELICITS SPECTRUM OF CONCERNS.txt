Physician: "What brings you in today?"

Patient: "I'm concerned about what I've been eating."

Physician: "Why is that?"

Patient: "My daughter, who primarily made the food at our house, has left for college recently. So I'm left to myself to prepare the food, and I'm not that knowledgeable."

Physician: "Okay. Yes. All right. So you're here to talk about your eating habits and how to change them and make them better. Do you have any other concerns for today?"

Patient: "Not particularly, no."

Physician: "Okay. Let me know if you do, if you remember anything as we're talking."

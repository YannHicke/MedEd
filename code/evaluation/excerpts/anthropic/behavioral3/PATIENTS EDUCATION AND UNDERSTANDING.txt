Here are the relevant quotes from the conversation where the physician educates the patient about their condition and assesses the patient's understanding:

Physician: "So would you like to discuss making a change?"
Patient: "Please."

Physician: "Okay, great. Absolutely. So I have a couple of ideas. You mentioned that you were financially stable. Did you say if you had insurance?"
Patient: "I do."
Physician: "Okay, that's good. Because one of my suggestions would be to have you talk to a registered dietician."
Patient: "Oh, okay."
Physician: "And insurance should cover about five visits or even more, and he or she can give you a good basis of different foods that are good for you and how to change your eating habits to make it more healthy."
Patient: "That sounds like a good idea."

Physician: "Now, about teaching you how to cook, is there any kind of, do you know of any kind of community resources in your area where they can do classes or little tutorials on cooking?"
Patient: "Yeah, it's funny that you mention that, because we get every fall and every spring something in the mail for the adult education, and at the high school in our area, they're doing a basic cooking class. I noticed that was on there."

Physician: "So, for example, you eat cereal with whole milk. Like, have you thought about trying 1% or 2% milk just to bring down the fat content a bit?"
Patient: "That's a good idea. I hadn't thought of it."
Physician: "Okay. Well, there's something you can do right now before seeing a dietician."

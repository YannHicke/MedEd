Physician: "Hi, Mr. Jones. I'm Natarcia. I'm a second-year medical student working with Dr. Smith today. Is it okay if I call you Mr. Jones?"

Patient: "That's fine."

Physician: "What brings you in today?"

Patient: "I'm concerned about what I've been eating."

Physician: "Why is that?"

Patient: "My daughter, who primarily made the food at our house, has left for college recently. So I'm left to myself to prepare the food, and I'm not that knowledgeable."

Physician: "Is she entering her first year?"

Patient: "She is."

Physician: "Where is she going to school?"

Patient: "She's at Michigan State University."

Physician: "Nice. Cool. That's great. Thank you. Good for her. All right. So what are you eating these days, then?"

Physician: "Okay. Yes. All right. So you're here to talk about your eating habits and how to change them and make them better. Do you have any other concerns for today?"

Patient: "Not particularly, no."

Physician: "Okay. Let me know if you do, if you remember anything as we're talking."

Patient: "Okay."

Physician: "So before I continue with talking about food and everything, why don't you tell me a little bit about yourself? How is your health?"

Here are the relevant quotes where the physician encouraged the patient to ask questions:

Physician: "Is there anything else that you're concerned about?"

Physician: "So just to make sure that I explained that clearly, I know I was a little jumbled in what I was saying, could you tell me what we just agreed upon and what you got from that?"

Here are relevant quotes showing the physician using verbal encouragement and facilitation skills to engage the patient:

Physician: "Hey, good thing you're here. That sounds good. Have you thought at all about types of exercise that you might be interested in?"

Physician: "Good. We can work with that. Is there anyone else who lives nearby that you think would be willing to exercise with you?"

Physician: "Sounds cool."

Physician: "That's good. That means we could have you get out and walk a little bit."

Physician: "Good. And let's see, so you have a husband who is fairly active, and he's also a teacher. Do you think he would be at all interested in exercising with you?"

Physician: "Okay. Let's see. So at the gym, another benefit is that they often have personal trainers. And what they do is for a first visit at the gym, gyms usually give the new client, say, an hour or so with a personal trainer to walk them around the gym and show them how to use different machines. You said that you would be interested in trying out machines."

Physician: "And that's good for a few reasons. It's good because you can feel good about what you've done. It's always good to look back and see that you've done it."

Here are the relevant quotes where the physician elicits and addresses the patient's beliefs and perspective on the illness:

Physician: "Well, we might want to talk to the doctor about that, too, to make sure that there are no underlying medical problems. But assuming everything is okay, is there anything that happened about a year ago that you can think of that would have made you tired for any reason?"

Patient: "No, because it wasn't a sudden jump. It was just, like, gradually getting more and more tired as the year went on."

Physician: "Do you have any ideas as to what it might be?"

Patient: "Maybe lack of exercise."

Physician: "Hey, good thing you're here. That sounds good. Have you thought at all about types of exercise that you might be interested in?"

Patient: "Yeah. If possible, maybe some swimming. And then I don't know that much about the machines, but, you know, I'd like to find out."

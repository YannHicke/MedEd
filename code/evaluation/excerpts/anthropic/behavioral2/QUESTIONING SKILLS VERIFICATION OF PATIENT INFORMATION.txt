Here are the relevant quotes where the physician sought clarification, verification, or specificity from the patient:

Physician: "Is Bill your husband?"
Patient: "Husband, yeah."

Physician: "So then you're not too far from your work. What type of neighborhood do you live in?"
Patient: "What we consider a very safe neighborhood."
Physician: "That's good. That means we could have you get out and walk a little bit."

Physician: "And do you think you'd like to exercise with someone, or do you see yourself exercising by yourself?"
Patient: "No, I'd rather have company when I start."

Physician: "And do you think your husband would also be interested in going to the gym in Manchester?"
Patient: "It would depend upon what time we go."

Physician: "So just to make sure that I explained that clearly, I know I was a little jumbled in what I was saying, could you tell me what we just agreed upon and what you got from that?"
Patient: "That I'm going to start at the gym that has the pool and go to that and see if my daughter and or my husband would like to do that and or go to the regular gym and have the personal trainer show me some of the bikes and things that they have and how to use them."

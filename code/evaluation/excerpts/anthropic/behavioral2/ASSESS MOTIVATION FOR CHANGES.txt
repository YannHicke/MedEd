Here are the relevant quotes from the conversation where the physician assessed the patient's motivation for lifestyle changes:

Physician: "So tell me why you want to start an exercise program."

Patient: "Well, I've been tired for the last almost year. You know, it seems to be getting progressively worse, so I don't know if it'll help, but I'm hoping it will."

Physician: "Have you thought at all about types of exercise that you might be interested in?"

Patient: "Yeah. If possible, maybe some swimming. And then I don't know that much about the machines, but, you know, I'd like to find out."

Physician: "So you are interested in starting an exercise program because you've been a little bit more tired lately and you think it might be due to lack of exercise. And you've thought a little bit about starting a program."

Physician: "Is there anything that you think would stop you from exercising? Anything that you're worried about?"

Patient: "Well, I'm kind of leery of going to a gym, although I guess they have the best facility. But since I have the problems and I just don't want to be in a bathing suit, I have horrendous varicose veins, which don't look too nice. So it's kind of making me â€“ I mean, I will do it probably, but it's going to be hard to get into."

Physician: "Tell me something about your family. Who do you live with?"
Patient: "I live with my husband and our dog, Bones. And that's it."

Physician: "How about family in the area? Do you have any other family members around?"
Patient: "Yeah. We have our daughter, Lucy, and she lives in Manchester. And we have our son, Robert, and he's in Westwood, New Jersey."

Physician: "Now, gyms can be somewhat of a financial burden. Do you have any financial concerns?"
Patient: "No. I would say we're living comfortably. Well, I've been thinking about retiring, and even if I retire and we lose that, it would still be okay."

Physician: "So we might be able to fit in paying for a gym. And do you have insurance?"
Patient: "Yeah, through my husband's work."

Physician: "Do you have support?"

Patient: "Sure. I mean, you know, my wife doesn't smoke, so she's definitely going to be happy and helpful. The only thing, I mean, like I said, most of my friends and coworkers are smokers, but not all of them. So that might present a problem."

Physician: "Okay. Well, what might help, what usually helps people, is let other people know up front that you're trying to quit and you need their support. You're going to be irritable, you're going to be moody, especially during the first couple of weeks when your body's going through the nicotine withdrawal. So prepare people for that. You may be avoiding social situations where you're around other smokers. Let people know that in advance, that it's nothing personal. You're just trying to avoid temptation until you get through this critical period as your body's going through that withdrawal. So those are some suggestions."

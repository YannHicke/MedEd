Physician: "Okay. Well, if you do have any questions after you go through the material, please make sure to give me a call."

Patient: "I will."

Physician: "Either myself or anyone in the office will certainly be willing to help you in whatever way we can. If you decide you want to go with one of the medications that we talked about, the Cantix or the Zyban, those do require a prescription. I'll be happy to write a prescription for you and provide any additional information about the products if you feel like you need it."

Patient: "Yeah, I mean, I'm never one to really jump at taking medications, so I think I'll probably try one of the over-the-counter things first."

Physician: "Okay, like the gum or the patch?"

Patient: "Right, right, and see how that goes."

Physician: "Okay, all right. So then what I'll do is I'll plan on calling you, say, within a couple of days."

Patient: "Okay."

Physician: "After your actual quit date, which you said is going to be two weeks from this Saturday. From this Saturday."

Patient: "right."

Physician: "Okay."

Patient: "Make it a weekend."

Physician: "All right, great. Unless I hear from you before then, if you have any questions. Sure, sure. As we talked about. Does that sound okay?"

Patient: "Sounds great."

Physician: "All right, all right, terrific. Dorothy should be in shortly to do your prophy, and maybe, hopefully, this will be the last time she's removing tobacco stains from your teeth."

Patient: "Yeah, that would be great."

Physician: "Okay. That would be great. Terrific. So then I'll see you at the end of the prophy visit to check your mouth."

Patient: "Great, thank you so much. I really appreciate it."

Physician: "Sounds good."

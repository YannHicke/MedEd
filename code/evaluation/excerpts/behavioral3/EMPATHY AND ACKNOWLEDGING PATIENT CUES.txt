Physician: "Oh, I'm sorry to hear that."

Physician: "Well, that's wonderful. I'm glad to hear that."

Physician: "That's great. That's really good."

Physician: "That's great. That's really good. Tell me a little bit more about your wife. When did you break up?"

Physician: "Oh, well, great."

Physician: "That's great. That's really good. Tell me a little bit more about your wife. When did you break up?"

Physician: "Oh, wonderful. So is that something you'd be willing to enroll in?"

Physician: "And that would also be a really good way for you to meet people and to get more integrated into your community, since you said you're kind of lonely out in the rural Burlington area."

Physician: "But you're looking into how to cook, so maybe that's just a default way to make friends."

Physician: "That's a good idea. I like that."

Physician: "I'm good. I'm glad. I'm glad."

Physician: "Well, I'm glad. I'm really glad that you're motivated to take the first step in eating healthfully, and that'll be really good for you, I'm sure."

Physician: "Very nice talking to you, Mr. Jones."

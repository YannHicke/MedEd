Physician: "So the Zoloft is making you feel better, but when you are feeling kind of down, do you feel like you have a social support network?"
Patient: "Well, the guys I work with are really the guys who I know best, and we don't get together much after work occasionally. And I don't spend that much time with my father either. I'm really kind of a loner, I'd say."
Physician: "Okay. All right. Do you call your daughter once in a while at college?"
Patient: "I've spoken to her twice. She's called me. I don't feel like pestering her, and she sounds like she's having a good time, although it's just getting going."
Physician: "So have you thought about asking her for her old recipes or anything like that?"
Patient: "I've been thinking about that, but I just don't feel like calling her at college and asking her to tell me what to prepare for food."
Physician: "I can understand that."
Patient: "I'm going to be seeing her at Thanksgiving, and I'm planning on asking her some questions then."
Physician: "Good. All right. But in the meantime, I could certainly help you out."
Physician: "You mentioned that you were financially stable. Did you say if you had insurance?"
Patient: "I do."
Physician: "Okay, that's good. Because one of my suggestions would be to have you talk to a registered dietician."
Patient: "Oh, okay."
Physician: "And insurance should cover about five visits or even more, and he or she can give you a good basis of different foods that are good for you and how to change your eating habits to make it more healthy."
Patient: "That sounds like a good idea."
Physician: "So that's something you'd be willing to start up with?"
Patient: "I'd like to do that as soon as possible."

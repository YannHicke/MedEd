Physician: "Nice. Cool. That's great. Thank you. Good for her."
Physician: "Okay. Yes. All right. So you're here to talk about your eating habits and how to change them and make them better. Do you have any other concerns for today?"
Physician: "Okay. Let me know if you do, if you remember anything as we're talking."
Physician: "Okay. Great. Well, that's wonderful. I'm glad to hear that."
Physician: "That's good."
Physician: "Oh, I'm sorry to hear that."
Physician: "That's great. That's really good."
Physician: "Oh, well, great."
Physician: "That's great. That's really good. Tell me a little bit more about your wife. When did you break up?"
Physician: "That's great. That's really good."
Physician: "Nice."
Physician: "Good. Okay."
Physician: "Oh, great. How convenient. That's great."
Physician: "Oh, wonderful. So is that something you'd be willing to enroll in?"
Physician: "And that would also be a really good way for you to meet people and to get more integrated into your community, since you said you're kind of lonely out in the rural Burlington area."
Physician: "But you're looking into how to cook, so maybe that's just a default way to make friends."
Physician: "That's a good idea. I like that."
Physician: "That's great. I'm glad."
Physician: "Okay. Great. And Mr. Jones, you talked about the community health class, the adult education at the high school. And that should start up in two weeks, you said?"
Physician: "Okay. Good."
Physician: "Very good. I'd be happy to sign that. I'm feeling pretty motivated. Great. This conversation is getting me excited."
Physician: "Oh, I'm good. I'm glad. I'm glad."
Physician: "Okay. Well, there's something you can do right now before seeing a dietician."
Physician: "Well, I'm glad. I'm really glad that you're motivated to take the first step in eating healthfully, and that'll be really good for you, I'm sure."
Physician: "Very nice talking to you, Mr. Jones."

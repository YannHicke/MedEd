Physician: "I've known you a long time, Kevin, so I have no doubt you're going to be a great dad. So that's just great news. Please make sure you give my congratulations to your wife."

Physician: "It sounds like you're doing a pretty good job, pretty reasonable job with your oral hygiene. We'll have to work on the flossing a little bit, but not bad."

Physician: "Well, that's great. And your wife is on you to quit also?"

Physician: "Well, actually, that's a really good thing. You know, quitting smoking is probably the best thing you could do for your health."

Physician: "Okay. Well, cravings usually last about maybe three to five minutes."

Physician: "So the whole key to success is to come up with distractions. What am I going to do in that time frame when I get that craving?"

Physician: "Okay. Well, you know, you shouldn't really be too hard on yourself because typically people who try to quit smoking are not successful on their first attempt. It often takes them several attempts before they finally do quit. The important thing is that you've tried, and it sounds like you're still really interested, that you're very motivated."

Physician: "Okay, great. Well, if you do have any questions after you go through the material, please make sure to give me a call."

Physician: "Either myself or anyone in the office will certainly be willing to help you in whatever way we can."

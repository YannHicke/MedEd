Physician: "We'll go out and get everything ready. We'll probably take a couple pictures of your teeth, x-rays. Is that all right, to take some x-rays of your teeth?"
Patient: "I guess so."
Physician: "Okay. All right. We'll try to do that and take a look in your mouth. I'll make sure we use some non-latex gloves so that won't be a problem. And I'll be back soon."
Patient: "Double check on the box, though, because I'm highly allergic."
Patient: "All right. I will make sure. I'll have you look at the box first. I'll put them out here so you can see them. Does that sound all right?"
Physician: "Sounds good. It was really nice to meet you, and I'll be back in a few minutes."
Patient: "All right. Thank you."

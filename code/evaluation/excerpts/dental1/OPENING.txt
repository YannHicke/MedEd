Physician: Hi, Ms. Austin. Is that right? 
Physician: I'm Kylie Haynes. I'm going to be taking a look today. 
Physician: So probably what the plan is going to be is that I'm going to ask you a few questions. They'll probably be dental-related and medical-related just so we can kind of get an idea of what's going on. And then we'll probably just do an exam, take a look in your mouth, and see what we can do and kind of make a plan for you. Does that sound good?

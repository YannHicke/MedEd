Patient: "Yes, it's been very hard."
Physician: "I can only imagine how tough that is. We're here to support you through this and find ways to make you feel better."

Physician: "No, I totally understand. We'll make sure that everything we do that you're comfortable with at first. We're not going to do, you know, anything that you're not comfortable with."

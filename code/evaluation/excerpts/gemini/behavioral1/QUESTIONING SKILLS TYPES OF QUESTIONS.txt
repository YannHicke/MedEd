Physician: "So besides your concern about quitting smoking, do you have any other things that you would like to speak about today?"
Physician: "Can I ask you why you take that?"
Physician: "Is there a particular reason?"
Physician: "So what makes you think it's going to work this time around?"
Physician: "Can I ask you how exactly that happened during your senior year?"
Physician: "So who really serves as your social support? Would you say it's your parents, or do you have friends in the area?"
Physician: "Do you have any questions at this time or any other concerns you've thought of?"
Physician: "So you mentioned your parents had insurance and they used medication. What do they use to quit smoking?"
Physician: "So do you know the effects of smoking on your body and what it can do potentially?"
Physician: "Is there anything in particular that triggers you to start smoking?"
Physician: "Do you smoke throughout the day, or is it something you're just smoking while you're driving in your car or while you're at home? Is there like a particular trigger for you?"
Physician: "So would you say you kind of wake up and you smoke, and then when you go to bed, you're also smoking and kind of like?"
Physician: "Do you have any questions or any other concerns?"
Physician: "So knowing your knowledge of smoking and knowing what triggers you and the fact that you are smoking continuously throughout the day, so it's not like there's a certain place that stimulates you. Is that correct?"
Physician: "So do you have anything in mind in particular?"
Physician: "Does that sound like something you would be able to do?"
Physician: "So why don't we pick a date in two weeks from now? So two weeks from today, we'll say that's your quit date."
Physician: "Because it would be more tempted, and it will be harder for you. So do you think that would be possible to kind of just remove yourself from situations?"
Physician: "But I only drink one coffee in the morning. Is that a problem?"
Physician: "Is that something that you're considering, or do you have any other options?"
Physician: "Sound good?"
Physician: "Any questions? Any other concerns?"
Physician: "So it's actually in a pill form, so it's actually very easy for you to take. Are you able to swallow pills?"
Physician: "Does that sound, you know?"
Physician: "Do those sound like things that you'd be interested in doing?"
Physician: "Does that sound good?"
Physician: "Would you be able to repeat back the plan that we've come up with?"
Physician: "So just kind of do you have any questions in the end, or is this any other concerns?"
Physician: "Does that sound like a good idea?"
Physician: "So we'll schedule a follow-up visit with Dr. Lelko when she comes in. So we look forward to seeing you in about three weeks."

Physician: So now we can actually form a plan together as to how you're going to go about quitting smoking. So the first thing that's a really good idea is to actually pick a date. So it could be an upcoming birthday, or it could be any day that you see suitable. Do you have anything in mind in particular?

Patient: Well, I'm ready to stop any time, but I don't know. I wanted to ask your recommendation about that.

Physician: Okay.

Patient: Because the last time I stopped just on my own, it didn't work.

Physician: Yeah, and I think the fact last two times you tried to quit were you went cold turkey.

Patient: Right.

Physician: That is very difficult. It's very difficult to give up a habit that you've had for quite a number of years. So I would suggest giving yourself like a week or two and picking a day.

Patient: Okay. 

Physician: It could be any day of the week, and you pick that day and you say to yourself, the day before you're going to clear your house and clear your car of anything that reminds you of smoking. So ashtrays, cigarettes, matches. If you smoke in a particular jacket or clothing, it's a good idea to wash those things to prepare yourself.

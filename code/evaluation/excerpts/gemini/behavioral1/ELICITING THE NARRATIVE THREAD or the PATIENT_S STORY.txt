Physician: So besides your concern about quitting smoking, do you have any other things that you would like to speak about today?

Physician: All right. If anything comes up, you can just stop me or just remember for later. Sound good?

Physician: Is there a particular reason?

Physician: Is there a particular reason?

Physician: Sorry to hear about that. 

Physician: I'm sure it has been difficult on you and your family. So you mentioned that you're taking vitamin D, and it's mostly to just help you with your mood. Is that correct?

Physician: Can I ask you how exactly that happened during your senior year?

Physician: Sorry about that. Have you considered going back to school or finishing up your education?

Physician: So it's probably been tough on you in terms of your father's health history and also school. So who really serves as your social support? Would you say it's your parents, or do you have friends in the area?

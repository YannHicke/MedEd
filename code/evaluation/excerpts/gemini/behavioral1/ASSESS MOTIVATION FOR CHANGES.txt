Physician: So what makes you think it's going to work this time around?
Patient: Well, that's the thing. I'm not sure, but my father got diagnosed with lung cancer, and he and my mother were able to stop. They tried a new treatment, so I want to try that as well.
Physician: Okay. So that's motivational to you in terms of your parents were able to do it, so hopefully you'll be able to follow suit with them.
Patient: That's what I hope, yeah.

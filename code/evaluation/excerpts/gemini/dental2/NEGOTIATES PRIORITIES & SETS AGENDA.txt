Physician: "Before we go into this any further, I'd like to know about your medical history. Do you have any significant medical problems right now?"
Patient: "No."
Physician: "Nothing you know of? No history of diabetes, high blood pressure, cancer, anything like that?"
Patient: "No."
Physician: "Okay. Are you taking any medications, whether prescription or herbal or alternative medications?"
Patient: "I just take the multivitamins."
Physician: "Okay."
Patient: "Some of my friends drink some Chinese tea or something to help the pregnancy, but I just take the vitamin only."
Physician: "You take the vitamin only? Mm-hmm. And this tea, is it commonly done in your culture, in your Korean, correct?"

Physician: "Generally, who do you consult with for your health decisions? Do you have someone, like, are you married? Do you have any family members other than your husband? I see that you're wearing a wedding ring. Do you have any family members other than your husband that you would consult for your health care decisions?"

Patient: "Usually I'm generally healthy, so not much to discuss with, but I live with my husband and parents-in-law."

Physician: "Okay."

Patient: "But this case I mentioned to my husband I have some gum bleeding, and he said, why don't you go to the dental clinic?"

Physician: "Okay." 

Patient: "That's the only time because, as I say, not much complication go with me."

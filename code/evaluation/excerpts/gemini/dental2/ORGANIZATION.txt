Physician: "Good morning, Ms. Park. My name is Tom."
Patient: "Hi."
Physician: "How are you doing today?"
Patient: "Very good. How are you?"
Physician: "Good, thank you. What brings you into the dental clinic today?"
Patient: "I have like bleeding in my gum, so I just wonder what happened."
Physician: "Okay. Are you feeling any pain with that bleeding?"
Patient: "Not much, but a little sore when I brush my teeth."
Physician: "Is that the only time that it happens when you're brushing your teeth or you're flossing?"
Patient: "During the day, sometimes sore, but mainly when I brush my teeth, sore and bleeding."
Physician: "Okay. Now it says in your chart here that you're pregnant?"
Patient: "Yes."
Physician: "Okay. How far along are you?"
Patient: "I think about 20 weeks."
Physician: "About 20 weeks?"
Patient: "Yes."
Physician: "Okay. And you're how old?"
Patient: "I'm 30 years old."
Physician: "30 years old. Excellent. How long is this bleeding, gums? How long have they been going on?"
Patient: "I think about a couple of weeks."
Physician: "A couple of weeks?"
Patient: "Mm-hmm."
Physician: "Okay. Sometimes there's a correlation during your second trimester, which you're just starting, between gingivitis and pregnancy. So sometimes this gum disease is brought on by some hormonal changes that are going on in your body."
Patient: "I didn't know that anything about my pregnancy lead this bleeding. Can you explain a little slow?"
Physician: "Sure. No problem. When you're pregnant, your body is producing hormones such as estrogen and progesterone in high levels."
Patient: "Okay."
Physician: "And when your mouth is not ideally clean, there's plaque on your teeth. In that plaque, there's bacteria."
Patient: "Okay."
Physician: "Sometimes the body's response against the bacteria with the hormones can be inflammation and can cause gingivitis."
Patient: "Okay."
Physician: "When you eliminate that plaque by brushing and flossing and having dental cleanings during your pregnancy, there will be no gingivitis."
Patient: "Okay."
Physician: "And actually, if you do not take care of this and you have plaque and gingivitis during your pregnancy, there has been research that's shown that that can lead to early birth, preterm birth, and low birth weight."
Patient: "Okay."
Physician: "So there's pretty strong evidence to suggest there is a correlation between the two."
Patient: "So if I have some gum bleeding, that's the older case has some gingivirus infection or maybe I have some other problem."
Physician: "It is an infection being that there is bacteria involved and the body is kind of responding against that bacteria, but it's nothing that you need antibiotics for. It's something that can be taken care of with good oral hygiene, brushing twice a day, flossing once a day. How often are you generally brushing and flossing?"
Patient: "Like usually once a day. I know it's like three times a day, but kind of lazy, busy."
Physician: "Oh, if you can do it once in the morning and once at night, that's fine, and we'll talk about the proper techniques a little later in the visit. Also, are you flossing?"
Patient: "Yeah, like only when I eat something and it's stuck in my teeth and I floss."
Physician: "Okay, you're going to want to do that once a day before you go to bed at least. Ideally, you want to do it after every meal. If we keep your oral hygiene up to status and we keep you coming in for dental cleanings and just have an overall dental exam, dental cleanings during your second trimester of pregnancy, the hope is that we can eliminate your gingivitis and eliminate the possibility that it might lead to an early birth for your baby and a low birth weight. Before we go into this any further, I'd like to know about your medical history. Do you have any significant medical problems right now?"

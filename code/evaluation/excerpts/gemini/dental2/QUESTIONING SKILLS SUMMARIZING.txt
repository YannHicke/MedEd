Physician: "So it looks like to me that a lot of this is from a preexisting condition that you had. You had some gum disease, and it looks like the pregnancy and the hormones that go along with pregnancy are kind of exacerbating the gum disease."

Physician: "So I'm just going to tell you what our overall plan is. What we're going to do is we'll, I think we have time now, we're going to do a complete periodontal exam on you. At that time, we'll be able to tell exactly how many visits you need to come in for. You're going to need one visit for a general cleaning. And then one visit for each quadrant that we decide you need a deep cleaning on. That can be between anywhere from one to four visits. Okay? So the most amount of visits that we're looking at is five. The least amount is one. But the number probably lies somewhere in between. So we'll be able to tell you that at the end of today's visit."

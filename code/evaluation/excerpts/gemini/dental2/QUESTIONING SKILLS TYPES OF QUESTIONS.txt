Physician: "How are you doing today?"
Physician: "What brings you into the dental clinic today?"
Physician: "Are you feeling any pain with that bleeding?"
Physician: "Is that the only time that it happens when you're brushing your teeth or you're flossing?"
Physician: "Now it says in your chart here that you're pregnant?"
Physician: "Okay. How far along are you?"
Physician: "About 20 weeks?"
Physician: "And you're how old?"
Physician: "30 years old. Excellent. How long is this bleeding, gums? How long have they been going on?"
Physician: "A couple of weeks?"
Physician: "How often are you generally brushing and flossing?"
Physician: "Also, are you flossing?"
Physician: "Before we go into this any further, I'd like to know about your medical history. Do you have any significant medical problems right now?"
Physician: "Nothing you know of? No history of diabetes, high blood pressure, cancer, anything like that?"
Physician: "Okay. Are you taking any medications, whether prescription or herbal or alternative medications?"
Physician: "You take the vitamin only? Mm-hmm. And this tea, is it commonly done in your culture, in your Korean, correct?"
Physician: "What is generally done during the pregnancy in terms of beliefs that are thought to be good for the baby, to keep the baby healthy?"
Physician: "So it's going to help the baby's getting, not getting, but it's kind of smaller, instead of the chubby baby. And at the same time, it's going to prevent my belly is not too huge, so it's going to maintain my body figure."
Physician: "So you don't want to get, in your culture, too big, and you want to keep the baby size smaller when you have the baby. "
Physician: "Okay. Are you doing anything else to alleviate the gum problems, the soreness that you're having from that? Are you putting any medications in your mouth?"
Physician: "You don't want to put any chemicals in your body. "
Physician: "But you mentioned about some, like, treatment to prevent this progression of whatever disease."
Physician: "We can do it as it currently is without medication. "
Physician: "Have you ever had that done before?"
Physician: "Was that the last time that you went to the dentist?"
Physician: "So you had a cleaning about a year ago is what you're saying?"
Physician: "Okay. And how was your experience?"
Physician: "And how did the deep cleaning work out for you? Did they see any improvement?"
Physician: "Do you have any other concerns or problems with the treatment that we're going to be giving?"
Physician: "Obviously, it's your decision whether or not you want to postpone it or not. But I'm highly recommending that you have it done now, during your second trimester, which you're just entering into. Because, like I said, there is a relationship between having the gum disease and low birth weight and premature birth. There's a high association between the two. If we can take care of your oral hygiene situation, give you a full dental cleaning, come into the office, and we'll clean everything off your teeth, that's basically going to solve the problem, if it's done correctly."
Physician: "So is that deep cleaning applied once or twice? I'd like to know how often you..."
Physician: "I know that's not the ideal situation for you. Do you have any concerns about sitting in the dental chair for a long period of time?"
Physician: "I mean, if I have only one spot has some bleeding, can you just do the deep cleaning only that spot, whatever, one fourth quadrant, instead of four, then I can just visit one, one time."
Physician: "But it sounds like you're going to need at least one from what you've been saying in your past history. Do you have any concerns about stressing the baby while you're in the chair? Do you have any anxiety when you're sitting in the dental chair or trouble sitting through a procedure?"
Physician: "Do you have some scientific evidence it's safe?"
Physician: "So do you understand everything that I'm telling you about? Could you just tell me what you think that I'm telling you, just so we're both on the same page?"
Physician: "Generally, who do you consult with for your health decisions? Do you have someone, like, are you married? Do you have any family members other than your husband? I see that you're wearing a wedding ring. Do you have any family members other than your husband that you would consult for your health care decisions?"
Physician: "Now, I just want to ask you, in the past have you or do you currently smoke or drink any alcoholic beverages?"
Physician: "You do not at all? Okay. You haven't used any illicit drugs such as marijuana or cocaine?"
Physician: "Anything else other than that?"
Physician: "So do you have any other questions for me today?"
Physician: "I think you pretty much explained. "
Physician: "But I'd like to know after, I mean, examine, like how many visits should I come if I decide to take the deep cleaning or whatever treatment?"
Physician: "Do you have any other questions for me?"
Physician: "Okay, great. It was a pleasure to meet you."

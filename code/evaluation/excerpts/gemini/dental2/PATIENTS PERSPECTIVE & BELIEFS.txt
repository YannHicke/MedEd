Physician: What is generally done during the pregnancy in terms of beliefs that are thought to be good for the baby, to keep the baby healthy?
Patient: Yeah. We have several options. Like I say, some friends take some medicine before pregnancy to help the wounds and everything, which I didn't. But another option is when you have some sign of miscarriage or something, then you can drink some kind of medicine or tea. But what I'm doing now is I put on some girdles, two kind of band-aid thing, to tighten up my belly to prevent my fetus getting fatter.

Physician: Okay. 

Patient: So it's going to help the baby's getting, not getting, but it's kind of smaller, instead of the chubby baby. And at the same time, it's going to prevent my belly is not too huge, so it's going to maintain my body figure.

Physician: Okay. So you don't want to get, in your culture, too big, and you want to keep the baby size smaller when you have the baby. 

Patient: Mm-hmm. 

Physician: Okay. 

Patient: So that's the only thing I do.

Physician: Okay. Are you doing anything else to alleviate the gum problems, the soreness that you're having from that? Are you putting any medications in your mouth?

Patient: Just I try to gargle with salt, but I don't know why this bleeding happened suddenly. So that's why I came here. And then I'm afraid to take any other medicine because I don't like to hurt my baby.

Physician: Okay. 

Patient: I don't know what that medicine, like, cause some of this, like. 

Physician: Some sort of problem to the baby.

Patient: Yeah. 

Physician: You don't want to put any chemicals in your body.

Physician: "Sometimes there's a correlation during your second trimester, which you're just starting, between gingivitis and pregnancy. So sometimes this gum disease is brought on by some hormonal changes that are going on in your body."

Physician: "When you're pregnant, your body is producing hormones such as estrogen and progesterone in high levels.  And when your mouth is not ideally clean, there's plaque on your teeth. In that plaque, there's bacteria. Sometimes the body's response against the bacteria with the hormones can be inflammation and can cause gingivitis. When you eliminate that plaque by brushing and flossing and having dental cleanings during your pregnancy, there will be no gingivitis."

Physician: "It is an infection being that there is bacteria involved and the body is kind of responding against that bacteria, but it's nothing that you need antibiotics for. It's something that can be taken care of with good oral hygiene, brushing twice a day, flossing once a day."

Physician: "But it looks right now just to be gingivitis, which is basically inflammation of the gums. And what we're going to do is give you a full dental cleaning."

Physician: "Yeah, I can completely understand that you don't want to put chemicals in your body with your belief system and whatnot during the pregnancy. But I think if we weigh the risks and benefits, I think it's less risky for the baby, with the research that we know about, to have some anesthetic if you need a deep cleaning, have some anesthetic put in your mouth, and have the cleaning done to decrease the amount of gingivitis in your mouth."

Physician: "There's a high association between the two. If we can take care of your oral hygiene situation, give you a full dental cleaning, come into the office, and we'll clean everything off your teeth, that's basically going to solve the problem, if it's done correctly."


Physician: "When we give you the anesthesia, we will keep it just in the area of your mouth that we're working on, and we'll try to give you as little as possible to make it effective. We'll make you nice and comfortable, and we'll give you the anesthesia. We'll do the cleaning, and the anesthesia should wear off within three or four hours."

Physician: "Yes, we have a lot of scientific evidence that anesthetic is safe. There are certain instances that have been described in the past where people have reacted poorly to the anesthetic, but there's no evidence currently that's linking getting dental anesthesia, such as lidocaine or novocaine, as you know it, to any harmful effects on the child."

Physician: "So do you understand everything that I'm telling you about? Could you just tell me what you think that I'm telling you, just so we're both on the same page?"

Physician: So I just want to move on now and ask you some more questions about your health. 
Physician: I just want to ask you also if there are any medicines that you take.
Physician: All right. I just want to ask you now about your family history.
Physician: So I'm just going to move on now and ask you some questions about your daily life and some of your health habits.
Physician: Okay. All right. I'm glad you have that support in your life. In terms of the history, I feel like we've gotten a pretty good idea of what's going on and the symptoms that you've had. So at this point, I think we just need to do the physical exam, see if you need any tests, and then we'll move on from there.

Physician: Can you start from the beginning and really tell me everything you can remember about when it started?
Patient: Sure. It woke me up last night a little after, I'd say about 1 o'clock. And it was an awful, I don't know, I want to say like tearing pain. So I got up. I kind of walked around. Woke up my husband. And, I don't know, it just didn't get any better. It was awful. 
Physician: So it woke you up out of sleep. 
Patient: Right. 
Physician: So this was about 1 in the morning. 
Patient: Mm-hmm. 
Physician: What did you do then? What happened next?
Physician: Okay. How long did the pain last?
Physician: Iâ€™m assuming you don't have it now.
Patient: No, I don't have it now.
Patient: Okay. I'd say a little before 5 o'clock this morning, all of a sudden, the pain went away.
Physician: Hmm. 
Patient: And I was peeing, and a lot of urine came out.
Physician: Okay. 
Patient: And I felt good. 
Physician: Okay. Was there anything different about the urine that came out?
Physician: Okay. Is that something that you've seen before?
Physician: Okay. And while this was going on, while the pain was going on, was it constant? Did it come and go, or was it really constant for those hours?
Physician: Okay. Yeah. Any other symptoms that you felt at the same time?
Physician: Okay. And did those symptoms last throughout with the pain as well, or did they come and go?
Physician: Okay. Have you had any changes in your bowels?
Physician: Okay. All right. And do you still get your menses?
Physician: Okay. And how long has it been since you got your period?
Physician: So it's been a while.
Physician: Okay. And did you have any vomiting?
Physician: Okay. And along with the sensation of having to pee and not being able to pee, was there any pain when you were able to pee?

Physician: So this was about 1 in the morning. 
Patient: Mm-hmm. 
Physician: What did you do then? What happened next?

Physician: Okay. So you never made it, but if you had really needed to go, he would have been able to help you. Take you.
Patient: Oh, yeah.
Physician: Okay. All right. I'm glad you have that support in your life. In terms of the history, I feel like we've gotten a pretty good idea of what's going on and the symptoms that you've had. So at this point, I think we just need to do the physical exam, see if you need any tests, and then we'll move on from there.

Physician: "Can you start from the beginning and really tell me everything you can remember about when it started?"
Physician: "So it woke you up out of sleep."
Physician: "Can you tell me more about the pain? It was a tearing pain."
Physician: "And where was it?"
Physician: "And did it move anywhere?"
Physician: "So you tried to walk around. That didn't seem to help." 
Physician: "Anything you did to try to help it?"
Physician: "So this was about 1 in the morning." 
Physician: "What did you do then? What happened next?"
Physician: "Sounds like it was a long morning for you."
Physician: "Okay. How long did the pain last?"
Physician: "Iâ€™m assuming you don't have it now."
Physician: "Okay. Was there anything different about the urine that came out?"
Physician: "Okay. Is that something that you've seen before?"
Physician: "And while this was going on, while the pain was going on, was it constant? Did it come and go, or was it really constant for those hours?"
Physician: "Okay. Yeah. Any other symptoms that you felt at the same time?"
Physician: "Okay. And did those symptoms last throughout with the pain as well, or did they come and go?"
Physician: "Have you had any changes in your bowels?"
Physician: "Like diarrhea, constipation?"
Physician: "And do you still get your menses?"
Physician: "Okay. And how long has it been since you got your period?"
Physician: "So it's been a while."
Physician: "And did you have any vomiting?"
Physician: "And along with the sensation of having to pee and not being able to pee, was there any pain when you were able to pee?"
Physician: "Okay. And does he treat you for any, or he or she?"
Physician: "Does she treat you for any medical conditions?"
Physician: "Okay. Have you been in the hospital ever?"

Physician: "Okay. Kidney stones?"
Physician: "Do you drink alcohol?"
Physician: "Okay. And no smoking?"
Physician: "And you don't do any other kinds of recreational drugs?"
Physician: "Okay. All right. So are you missing work today?"
Physician: "Okay. Is that going to be a problem?"
Physician: "They're pretty understanding." 
Physician: "Can you tell me a little bit about your support systems?"
Physician: "Last night when you had this pain, was it ever so bad that you thought about going to the hospital?"
Physician: "So you never made it, but if you had really needed to go, he would have been able to help you. Take you."

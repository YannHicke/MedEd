Physician: Can you start from the beginning and really tell me everything you can remember about when it started?

Physician: So it woke you up out of sleep. 

Physician: Can you tell me more about the pain? It was a tearing pain.

Physician: And where was it?

Physician: And did it move anywhere?

Physician: Okay. All right. So you tried to walk around. That didn't seem to help. 

Physician: Anything you did to try to help it?

Physician: Okay. So this was about 1 in the morning. 

Physician: What did you do then? What happened next?

Physician: Sounds like it was a long morning for you.

Physician: Okay. How long did the pain last?

Physician: Iâ€™m assuming you don't have it now.

Physician: Okay. 

Physician: Was there anything different about the urine that came out?

Physician: Okay. Is that something that you've seen before?

Physician: Okay. And while this was going on, while the pain was going on, was it constant? Did it come and go, or was it really constant for those hours?

Physician: Okay. Yeah. Any other symptoms that you felt at the same time?

Physician: Okay. And did those symptoms last throughout with the pain as well, or did they come and go?

Physician: Okay. Have you had any changes in your bowels?

Physician: Like diarrhea, constipation?

Physician: Okay. All right. And do you still get your menses?

Physician: Okay. And how long has it been since you got your period?

Physician: So it's been a while.

Physician: Okay. And did you have any vomiting?

Physician: Okay. And along with the sensation of having to pee and not being able to pee, was there any pain when you were able to pee?

Physician: Right. 


Physician: Okay. Can you tell me a little bit about your support systems?

Physician: Okay. Okay. Last night when you had this pain, was it ever so bad that you thought about going to the hospital?

Physician: Okay. So you never made it, but if you had really needed to go, he would have been able to help you. Take you.

Physician: Okay. All right. I'm glad you have that support in your life. In terms of the history, I feel like we've gotten a pretty good idea of what's going on and the symptoms that you've had.

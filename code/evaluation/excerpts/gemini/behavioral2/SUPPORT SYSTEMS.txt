Physician: "So tell me something about your family. Who do you live with?"
Patient: "I live with my husband and our dog, Bones. And that's it."
Physician: "How old is your husband?"
Patient: "He's 63."
Physician: "Does he have any medical problems that you know of?"
Patient: "Yeah. He has high blood pressure, but not such that he needs medication for it."
Physician: "Is he active?"
Patient: "Not overly active, no."
Physician: "About the same as you?"
Patient: "Right."
Physician: "How about family in the area? Do you have any other family members around?"
Patient: "Yeah. We have our daughter, Lucy, and she lives in Manchester. And we have our son, Robert, and he's in Westwood, New Jersey."
Physician: "So you have one child in the area and one a little farther away."
Physician: "Now, gyms can be somewhat of a financial burden. Do you have any financial concerns?"
Patient: "No. I would say we're living comfortably. Well, I've been thinking about retiring, and even if I retire and we lose that, it would still be okay."
Physician: "It would be okay."
Patient: "Yeah."
Physician: "So we might be able to fit in paying for a gym. And do you have insurance?"
Patient: "Yeah, through my husband's work."

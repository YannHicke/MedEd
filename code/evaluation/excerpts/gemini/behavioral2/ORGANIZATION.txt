Physician: "So what brings you into the office today?"
Patient: "Well, I'm wanting to do something with exercise, and I'm not really sure what I want to do or why even to do it."
Physician: "Okay. Well, then I'm glad you came in. We can certainly talk about that. Is there anything else that you're concerned about?"
Patient: "No."
Physician: "Great. So then what I'm going to do is I'm going to ask you a few questions to get a medical history and some reasons behind your wanting to do an exercise program, and then we can get into talking about how to start that. Does that sound okay?"
Patient: "Okay. Sounds great."
Physician: "So just to make sure that I explained that clearly, I know I was a little jumbled in what I was saying, could you tell me what we just agreed upon and what you got from that?"
Patient: "That I'm going to start at the gym that has the pool and go to that and see if my daughter and or my husband would like to do that and or go to the regular gym and have the personal trainer show me some of the bikes and things that they have and how to use them."
Physician: "Sure. Good. That sounds good. And so I'll let you talk to your family members and we'll set you up for an appointment within the next week."

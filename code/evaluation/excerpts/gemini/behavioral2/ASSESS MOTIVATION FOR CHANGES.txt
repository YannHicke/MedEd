Physician: So tell me why you want to start an exercise program.

Physician: And have you tried, since you were about 25, to start some sort of regular exercise routine?

Physician: Is there anything that you think would stop you from exercising? Anything that you're worried about?

Physician: And do you think you'd be less worried about those if your daughter were with you?

Physician: Do you think your husband would also be interested in going to the gym in Manchester?

Physician: Would you like to start exercising as of a few days from now? Would you be ready for that?

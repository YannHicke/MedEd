Physician: "That's fantastic. Congratulations."
Physician: "Congratulations. Have you and your wife thought about any names yet for the baby?"
Physician: "I've known you a long time, Kevin, so I have no doubt you're going to be a great dad. So that's just great news. Please make sure you give my congratulations to your wife."
Physician: "That's great. That's fantastic." 
Physician: "Well, that's great."
Physician: "Okay, all right."
Physician: "Okay, all right. Have you, you said you tried to quit cold turkey in the past. Have you ever used any of the tobacco cessation products? Are you aware of any of those?"
Physician: "Okay." 
Physician: "Okay. Would you recommend any particular one?"
Physician: "Okay."
Physician: "Okay, all right. So do you think you would want to quit, do you think?"
Physician: "Okay, all right."
Physician: "Okay."

Physician: "Okay." 
Physician: "Okay."
Physician: "Okay." 
Physician: "Okay." 
Physician: "Okay." 
Physician: "Okay. So why don't we try to come up with a quit date? You said your wife doesn't smoke, so I would suggest trying to quit over a weekend when you're away from work and you're away from people who are smoking around you. How does that sound?"
Physician: "Okay. That's great because that would give you some time to prepare." 
Physician: "Okay." 
Physician: "Okay." 
Physician: "Okay. That would be great. Terrific. So then I'll see you at the end of the prophy visit to check your mouth."
Physician: "Sounds good."
Physician: "Okay, great. Well, if you do have any questions after you go through the material, please make sure to give me a call."
Physician: "Okay, like the gum or the patch?"
Physician: "Okay, all right. So then what I'll do is I'll plan on calling you, say, within a couple of days."
Physician: "Okay." 
Physician: "Okay." 
Physician: "All right, great. Unless I hear from you before then, if you have any questions. Sure, sure. As we talked about. Does that sound okay?"
Physician: "Okay. That would be great. Terrific. So then I'll see you at the end of the prophy visit to check your mouth."
Physician: "Sounds good."

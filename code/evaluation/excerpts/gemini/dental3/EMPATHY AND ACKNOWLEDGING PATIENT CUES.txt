Physician: "That's fantastic. Congratulations."
Physician: "Congratulations. Have you and your wife thought about any names yet for the baby?"
Physician: "I've known you a long time, Kevin, so I have no doubt you're going to be a great dad. So that's just great news. Please make sure you give my congratulations to your wife."
Physician: "That's great. That's fantastic."
Physician: "Okay. Well, you know, you shouldn't really be too hard on yourself because typically people who try to quit smoking are not successful on their first attempt. It often takes them several attempts before they finally do quit. The important thing is that you've tried, and it sounds like you're still really interested, that you're very motivated."
Physician: "Okay. That's great because that would give you some time to prepare."

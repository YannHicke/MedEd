Physician: Any questions that you have at this point?
Patient: No. I mean, this is a new thing. Well, not that new, but I feel like I'm a lot more ready than I was last time. So this is good.
Physician: Okay, great. Well, if you do have any questions after you go through the material, please make sure to give me a call.
Patient: I will. 
Physician: Either myself or anyone in the office will certainly be willing to help you in whatever way we can. If you decide you want to go with one of the medications that we talked about, the Cantix or the Zyban, those do require a prescription. I'll be happy to write a prescription for you and provide any additional information about the products if you feel like you need it.

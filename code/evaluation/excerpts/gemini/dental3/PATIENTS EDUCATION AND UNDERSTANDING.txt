Physician: "You're probably already aware that it's a risk factor for a lot of significant medical problems, like lung disease, heart attack, stroke, cancer. The shortness of breath and the bronchitis may be related to the smoking, but you probably should definitely have your doctor check that to make sure."

Physician: "Then there's the secondhand effects of smoking that can be, you know, the secondhand smoke can be harmful to the people around you. And for your baby, that could cause some problems too, could cause some, you know, breathing problems, ear infections, things like that. And, you know, you talked about staining of your teeth. There's other harmful effects of smoking in the mouth. Gum disease, oral cancer puts you at risk for that. It can affect your sense of taste. So when you quit, you know, you get a lot of benefits. You get short-term benefits. You'll probably have a lot more energy. You'll probably be able to breathe better. And then over time, you know, you reduce your risk for all the significant medical problems that, you know, we just talked about."

Physician: "So do you think you would want to quit, do you think?"

Physician: "Okay. Have you, you said you tried to quit cold turkey in the past. Have you ever used any of the tobacco cessation products? Are you aware of any of those?"

Physician: "Are all these pretty safe? I mean, you know, smoking is harmful, so these replacement things, is that safe?"

Physician: "Is it something you're thinking about seriously at this point?"

Physician: "Have you ever thought about what triggers your desire to smoke? Like, when you get a craving, when does that typically happen?"

Physician: "Sometimes it's actually helpful to keep a log of when you smoke and when you get your cravings. You know, we talked about all the different medications, but it's important to keep in mind that none of those are magic bullets. To really be successful with a quit attempt, you have to really be ready. It sounds like you might be at that point."

Physician: "You have to sort of anticipate in advance what your triggers are going to be, what's going to set off a craving for you, and sort of come up with a plan. Think about it in advance. What will I do when I get that craving for the cigarette? How will I deal with that?"

Physician: "So the whole key to success is to come up with distractions. What am I going to do in that time frame when I get that craving?"

Physician: "Do you think at this point that you're willing to set an actual quit date, say, within the next month?"

Physician: "Okay. So why don't we try to come up with a quit date? You said your wife doesn't smoke, so I would suggest trying to quit over a weekend when you're away from work and you're away from people who are smoking around you. How does that sound?"

Physician: "Okay. That's great because that would give you some time to prepare."

Physician: "Any questions that you have at this point?"

Physician: "How's everything going for you?"
Physician: "Have you been having any problems since you were last here for your last visit?"
Physician: "Okay. And how about your general health? Have there been any changes in your health since you were last here?"
Physician: "Okay. No other problems besides that?"
Physician: "Why do you think that happened?"
Physician: "Okay, all right. So do you think you would want to quit, do you think?"
Physician: "Okay, all right. Have you, you said you tried to quit cold turkey in the past. Have you ever used any of the tobacco cessation products? Are you aware of any of those?"
Physician: "Okay. Would you recommend any particular one?"
Physician: "Is it something you're thinking about seriously at this point?"
Physician: "Okay, all right. Have you ever thought about what triggers your desire to smoke? Like, when you get a craving, when does that typically happen?"
Physician: "Okay, yeah, that's pretty common."
Physician: "Okay. Do you have any suggestions as to how to do that? Because I'm anticipating some really strong ones. Just from trying to quit in the past, they're real and they're there, and I really don't know what to do there."
Physician: "Do you have support?"
Physician: "Any questions that you have at this point?"

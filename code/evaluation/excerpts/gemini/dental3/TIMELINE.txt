Physician: Have you been having any problems since you were last here for your last visit?
Patient: Nothing major. You know, occasional bleeding of the gums when I brush and, you know, the usual tobacco stains on the teeth. And the flossing, I know you said to do it every day, but it slips my mind sometimes. It probably averages out to about three or four times a week.
Physician: Okay. And how often have you been brushing?
Patient: At least twice a day.
Physician: Oh, right. It sounds like you're doing a pretty good job, pretty reasonable job with your oral hygiene. We'll have to work on the flossing a little bit, but not bad. How about your general health? Have there been any changes in your health since you were last here?
Patient: Again, nothing major. A few weeks ago I had an episode of bronchitis, and with that came a little bit of shortness of breath. Like when I go running, you know, and when I run sometimes I get a little short of breath or if I take the stairs at work.
Physician: Okay. No other problems besides that?
Patient: No.
Physician: Have you seen your physician recently?
Patient: Not in at least a year, so I'll have to get on that.
Physician: Okay. Yeah, that's important, especially if you're having symptoms like shortness of breath. 
Patient: Yeah. 
Physician: So make sure that your physician evaluates that. Are you on any medications right now?
Patient: You know, the occasional Advil for a headache, and then I take a Centrum every day.
Physician: Okay, great. Any changes in your alcohol intake?
Patient: No. I mean, two, three glasses of wine a week with dinner. That's about it.
Physician: Okay. How about your tobacco use?
Patient: I was smoking a pack a day, and then more recently I've tried to cut back to about 10 to 15 cigarettes per day.
Physician: That's great. That's fantastic. 
Patient: Yeah, yeah. I mean, I'm really thinking about trying to make a serious effort to quit with the baby on the way. I really, I know it's, I mean, I shouldn't be smoking around the baby. So, yeah.
Physician: Do you, do you, have you ever tried to quit before?
Patient: Yeah, I tried a few times cold turkey, and that never lasted more than a week.
Physician: Why do you think that happened?
Patient: I mean, a couple. I mean, job stress, you know, project deadlines, those sorts of things. I mean, you know, when you're going out with your friends. A lot of my friends and coworkers smoke, so it's kind of like a situational thing. Just light one up, and it's just really hard to resist that temptation.

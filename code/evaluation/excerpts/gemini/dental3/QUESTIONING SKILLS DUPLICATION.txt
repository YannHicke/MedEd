Physician: "Have you, you said you tried to quit cold turkey in the past. Have you ever used any of the tobacco cessation products? Are you aware of any of those?"

Physician: "Okay, all right. So do you think you would want to quit, do you think?"

Physician: "Okay. So why don't we try to come up with a quit date? You said your wife doesn't smoke, so I would suggest trying to quit over a weekend when you're away from work and you're away from people who are smoking around you. How does that sound?"

Physician: "Would that be a reasonable time frame for you?"

Physician: "So then what I'll do is I'll plan on calling you, say, within a couple of days. After your actual quit date, which you said is going to be two weeks from this Saturday. From this Saturday."

Physician: "As we talked about. Does that sound okay?"

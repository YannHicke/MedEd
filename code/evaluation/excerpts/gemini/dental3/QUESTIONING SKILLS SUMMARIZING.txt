Physician: "So today we talked about your upcoming fatherhood and how exciting that is, we also discussed your oral hygiene, and you're doing a pretty good job brushing but we need to work on the flossing. You mentioned occasional bleeding of the gums when you brush and the usual tobacco stains on the teeth. You also mentioned an episode of bronchitis a few weeks ago and some shortness of breath with exertion. You haven't seen your physician in at least a year. You're taking Advil occasionally and a Centrum daily. Your alcohol intake is two to three glasses of wine a week with dinner, and your tobacco use is down to 10 to 15 cigarettes a day from a pack a day. You're thinking of quitting, especially with the baby on the way. We discussed the health risks associated with smoking, including lung disease, heart attack, stroke, cancer, and the harmful effects of secondhand smoke. We also talked about the various tobacco cessation products available, including the patch, gum, lozenges, Chantix, and Zyban. We discussed the cost of these products and the importance of insurance coverage. You seem ready to quit and we talked about setting a quit date, identifying triggers, and developing coping mechanisms. We also discussed the importance of having a support system in place. You mentioned that your wife is supportive, but most of your friends and coworkers smoke. We talked about strategies for dealing with social situations where smoking is present. We also talked about the possibility of using medication to help you quit, such as Chantix or Zyban, but you said you would prefer to try the over-the-counter options first, like the gum or patch. We agreed that you would set a quit date for two weeks from this Saturday and that I would call you a couple of days after your quit date to see how you're doing.  We also discussed the importance of preparing for your quit attempt by cleaning out ashtrays, getting rid of cigarette lighters, and letting people know that you're quitting. You seemed motivated and ready to make a serious attempt to quit smoking. We reviewed a pamphlet that provides information on quitting smoking, and I offered to provide you with a prescription for Chantix or Zyban if you decide to go that route. You said you'd like to try the over-the-counter options first. We agreed that I would call you in a couple of days after your quit date, which is two weeks from this Saturday, to see how you're doing. Does that summarize everything we talked about today?"

Patient: "Yes, I think so."

Physician: "And then also, very importantly, you have to have a support system in place, family, friends, coworkers. You've got to get people on board to help you because typically you can't do this alone."

Physician: "Do you have support?"

Patient: "Sure. I mean, you know, my wife doesn't smoke, so she's definitely going to be happy and helpful. The only thing, I mean, like I said, most of my friends and coworkers are smokers, but not all of them. So that might present a problem."

Physician: "So what brought you here today?"
Physician: "Can you describe the pain to me a little bit?"
Physician: "It's throbbing pain."
Physician: "How long is the pain, like the duration of the pain?" 
Physician: "Like how long have I had it or how long does it last?"
Physician: "Yeah, yeah. Kind of just describe a little bit to me." 
Physician: "It's been about 10 days?"
Physician: "Have you had any problems with it before this or it's just started at 10 days, 10 days ago?"
Physician: "Why did you have the fillings removed? What do you think was the problem?"
Physician: "Okay. You know, that new car smell and all that." 
Physician: "Are you allergic to anesthetics?"
Physician: "So you feel like you've had dental work in the past pretty much on a regular basis. Is that correct?"
Physician: "And just you were in a car, and you're feeling like as soon as you had the new car, certain health problems were starting to happen. Is that correct?"
Physician: "All right, and so do you think the problems with your teeth, you think they're related to chemical sensitivities? Is that my understanding?"
Physician: "So you think it's just some chemical sensitivities to your teeth, and that's why you had the amalgam fillings removed then. Is that correct?"
Physician: "Now, do you brush and floss regularly?"
Physician: "Okay. How often?"
Physician: "What kind of products are you using again? I know you mentioned it." 
Physician: "Just baking soda?"
Physician: "So this may seem like a broad question, but I know you mentioned it before. What are some of the significant medical problems that you have?"
Physician: "Okay. Yeah, I noticed you did have the oxygen tank, so I was going to ask you about that. How often do you have to use it?"
Physician: "And why do you have it?"
Physician: "Okay. All right. And you have to use it all the time or just outside of the house?"
Physician: "Okay. All right. And did a doctor prescribe that for you?"
Physician: "And how long have you used it?"
Physician: "Do you think you're going to —I think it will be fine if you use it here. If you feel more comfortable, you know, with coming to the dental appointments, with it, that's all right. Do you think it will be fine if we lean you back in the chair and things like that? Will you be all right?"
Physician: "Any other significant medical problems besides the shortness of breath?"
Physician: "Okay, but nothing has been diagnosed?"
Physician: "Okay. All right. Any, for example, any, like, heart problems?"
Physician: "Lung problems?"
Physician: "Just the shortness of breath?"
Physician: "Anything diagnosed of it?"
Physician: "With the shortness of breath?"
Physician: "Yeah."
Physician: "Anything with, like, type 2 diabetes or type 1 diabetes, anything like that?"
Physician: "You don't have that? Okay."
Physician: "Your mother does?"
Physician: "All right. Any other?"
Physician: "She has type 2. Any other medical problems that run in the family, heart problems or lung problems or anything like that?"
Physician: "Just the diabetes? All right. Do you live with your mom, or does she live close by?"
Physician: "You live with her. Okay. So do you have a little bit of family support then at home?"
Physician: "But no heart murmurs or any diagnosed type of heart problem?"
Physician: "All right. And are you taking any medications at all?"
Physician: "No medications at all. Okay. But you are taking some multivitamins or some type of vitamins?"
Physician: "Okay. What about any herbs or anything, non-prescribed medications?"
Physician: "There are a few that, you know, anesthetics that we usually use here at the health center. You don't want to use any?"
Physician: "Any?"
Physician: "Besides the anesthetics and the latex, any other allergies at all that you know of?"
Physician: "Do you drink?"
Physician: "No. What about smoking?"
Physician: "Any infectious diseases at all, such as HIV?"
Physician: "Hepatitis?"
Physician: "Tuberculosis? Anything like that?"
Physician: "No? Okay. All right. So I think I have a good idea about medical history a little bit. So have you been seeing a physician on a regular basis?"
Physician: "Were you married or are you married at all?"
Physician: "So you just live with your mom who's a little bit disabled."
Physician: "What about transportation? Is transportation going to be a problem or not?"
Physician: "So you would be able to come if a friend could drive you?"
Physician: "Okay. All right. And do you – I know you used to mention you were a nurse. Do you work at all now or no?"
Physician: "So timeframes for the appointments wouldn't be too much of a problem then?"
Physician: "Does that sound all right?"
Physician: "Is that all right, to take some x-rays of your teeth?"
Physician: "Does that sound all right?"

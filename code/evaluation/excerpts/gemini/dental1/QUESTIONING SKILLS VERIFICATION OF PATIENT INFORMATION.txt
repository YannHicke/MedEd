Physician: "Can you describe the pain to me a little bit?"
Physician: "How long is the pain, like the duration of the pain? "
Physician: "Yeah, yeah. Kind of just describe a little bit to me." 
Physician: "It's been about 10 days?"
Physician: "Have you had any problems with it before this or it's just started at 10 days, 10 days ago?"
Physician: "So just so I've got an idea, you're feeling like you have some abscesses in your mouth and they are on both sides on the lower."
Physician: "And it's been about 10 days, but you had some mercury fillings, some probably amalgam, are they silver-colored?"
Physician: "Silver-colored fillings in the past and you think that might be the cause and you had those removed about two years ago, is that correct?"
Physician: "About two years ago. Okay. Alright. Just so I can get an idea. Now, what about, I'm going to ask just a little bit more about your past dental history because I've kind of got an idea about your chief complaint right now. We'll address that first today, but I want to kind of get an overall picture. Have you had dental work? You've had dental work done in the past then?"
Physician: "What kind of dental work have you had in the past? Just the wisdom teeth and a few fillings, is that about it?"
Physician: "And did you see the dentist regularly or just when it was painful for you?"
Physician: "Why did you have the fillings removed? What do you think was the problem?"
Physician: "Okay. You know, that new car smell and all that. And for some reason, I didn't know at the time, but I started getting, you know, dizzy, short of breath,"
Physician: "Are you allergic to anesthetics?"
Physician: "Certain anesthetics? Okay. I'll ask you just a few more questions about that later. We'll get into a little bit of the medical history at first."
Physician: "So you feel like you've had dental work in the past pretty much on a regular basis. Is that correct?"
Physician: "And just you were in a car, and you're feeling like as soon as you had the new car, certain health problems were starting to happen. Is that correct?"
Physician: "All right, and so do you think the problems with your teeth, you think they're related to chemical sensitivities? Is that my understanding?"
Physician: "So you think it's just some chemical sensitivities to your teeth, and that's why you had the amalgam fillings removed then. Is that correct?"
Physician: "Okay. How often?"
Physician: "Just baking soda?"
Physician: "Just baking soda?"
Physician: "You don't have that? Okay."
Physician: "She has type 2. Any other medical problems that run in the family, heart problems or lung problems or anything like that?"
Physician: "Just the diabetes? All right. Do you live with your mom, or does she live close by?"
Physician: "You live with her. Okay. So do you have a little bit of family support then at home?"
Physician: "But no heart murmurs or any diagnosed type of heart problem?"
Physician: "No medications at all. Okay. But you are taking some multivitamins or some type of vitamins?"
Physician: "No. Okay. All right. I know you mentioned latex as being an allergy and some anesthetics, but you don't know what kind of anesthetics?"
Physician: "Any?"
Physician: "So you're pretty familiar with all that."
Physician: "So you just live with your mom who's a little bit disabled."
Physician: "So you would be able to come if a friend could drive you?"
Physician: "Okay. So timeframes for the appointments wouldn't be too much of a problem then?"
Physician: "Is that all right, to take some x-rays of your teeth?"
Physician: "I'll put them out here so you can see them. Does that sound all right?"

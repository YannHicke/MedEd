Physician: "It sounds like you've been quite diligent with your exercise routine. Can you tell me more about what you do?"
Patient: "I try to walk every morning."
Physician: "Every morning, that’s impressive! How has it been affecting your energy levels?"
Patient: "I've noticed I feel less tired during the day."
Physician: "That’s great to hear. It shows how your efforts are paying off."

Physician: "No, I totally understand. We'll make sure that everything we do that you're comfortable with at first. We're not going to do, you know, anything that you're not comfortable with."

Physician: "So just so I've got an idea, you're feeling like you have some abscesses in your mouth and they are on both sides on the lower."

Physician: "And it's been about 10 days, but you had some mercury fillings, some probably amalgam, are they silver-colored?"

Physician: "Silver-colored fillings in the past and you think that might be the cause and you had those removed about two years ago, is that correct?"

Physician: "So you feel like you've had dental work in the past pretty much on a regular basis. Is that correct?"

Physician: "And just you were in a car, and you're feeling like as soon as you had the new car, certain health problems were starting to happen. Is that correct?"

Physician: "All right, and so do you think the problems with your teeth, you think they're related to chemical sensitivities? Is that my understanding?"

Physician: "So you think it's just some chemical sensitivities to your teeth, and that's why you had the amalgam fillings removed then. Is that correct?"

Physician: "So now I kind of have an idea of a little bit about your dental history. So I want to ask you a few questions about medical history because it seems like from your research you've kind of gotten an idea, too, that medical and dental history will be kind of related. It may be part to the problem. It may not. But I'll just ask you a few questions and take it from there. All right? "

Physician: "So we have shortness of breath. We're going to try to start out with go ahead and using the oxygen while you're comfortable. You have had some chest pain that kind of comes and goes."

Physician: "I think I have a good idea about medical history a little bit."

Physician: "I think I have a fairly good idea of medical history and dental history."

Physician: "All right, so tell me a little bit about what brought you to the office today."
Patient: "Well, I'm having a pain in the left part of my chest and I'm worried it could be my heart."
Physician: "Oh, I'm really sorry to hear about that. Can you tell me a little bit about that?"
Patient: "Sure. It's an aching pain and sometimes it gets sharp and it moves a little bit and I hear that can be heart pain."
Physician: "Oh, okay. And what makes it sharp?"
Patient: "When I move, when I lift things with my left arm."
Physician: "Okay, and is there anything that makes the pain better?"
Patient: "I've been taking some Advil. That's helped a little bit."
Physician: "Okay, how much Advil are you taking?"
Patient: "Two in the morning and two in the afternoon."
Physician: "Okay, do you know what the dose is of the Advil?"
Patient: "I don't."
Physician: "Okay, anything else that makes your pain better?"
Patient: "Just not moving."
Physician: "Okay, and you said lifting makes it worse."
Patient: "Yeah."
Physician: "Okay, do you lift on a regular basis or did you notice it somehow?"
...
Physician: "Okay. So in terms of your past medical history, do you have any ongoing medical problems?"
Patient: "Nothing serious."
Physician: "Nothing serious? Okay. Do you take any medicines on a daily basis?"
...
Physician: "Okay. So in terms of your social history, we talked about your work. You lift boxes. Can you tell me about your living situation?"
...
Physician: "Okay. So it sounds like you, we already talked about your job and you lift boxes at work and your free time you like to mountain bike and you do drink about a six pack of beer on the weekends and you have been drinking and mountain biking at the same time. And this past weekend you were mountain biking when your chest pain started because you fell off your mountain bike."
Patient: "Yes."
Physician: "Okay. And you mentioned you also occasionally smoke cigarettes and you don't use any drugs. Is that correct?"

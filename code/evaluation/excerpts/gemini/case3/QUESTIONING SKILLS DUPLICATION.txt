Physician: "Okay. So you hit your chest when you were mountain biking and your chest pain started after that."
Patient: "Yeah."
Physician: "Okay. And in terms of other things that you do in your free time, do you drink any alcohol?"
Patient: "Yep. I do on the weekends."
Physician: "On the weekends. Okay. How much do you drink on the weekends?"
Patient: "Usually about a six pack."
Physician: "Okay. And so you were mountain biking on the weekend and you drink on the weekend. Had you been drinking at the time when you were mountain biking?"
Patient: "Yeah."
Physician: "Okay. Do you think that that affected you at all?"
Patient: "I don't think so. I mean, I didn't completely finish the six beers, but, and that's, you know, something I'm used to."
Physician: "Okay. Have you ever been injured when drinking in the past?"
Patient: "Like I said, I, you know, mountain biking, sometimes you, you slip or you might fall a little bit or some branches hit you. But, you know, never anything that hurt my heart before."
Physician: "Okay. And do you smoke any cigarettes?"
Patient: "Occasionally when I drink or I'm hanging out with my friends."
Physician: "Okay. And do you use any drugs?"
Patient: "I don't."
Physician: "You don't. Okay. So it sounds like you, we already talked about your job and you lift boxes at work and your free time you like to mountain bike and you do drink about a six pack of beer on the weekends and you have been drinking and mountain biking at the same time. And this past weekend you were mountain biking when your chest pain started because you fell off your mountain bike."
Patient: "Yes."
Physician: "Okay. And you mentioned you also occasionally smoke cigarettes and you don't use any drugs. Is that correct?"
Patient: "That's true."

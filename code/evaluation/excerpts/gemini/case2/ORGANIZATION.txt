Physician: So, I just wanted to start by figuring out why you're here today.

Patient: Well, I had an episode last night where I had really bad pain low in my belly.

Physician: Okay. Is there anything else that you want to make sure we address today before we talk more about that pain?

Patient: Well, I guess the other thing is every once in a while I feel like I'm leaking urine.

Physician: Okay. 

Patient: And I really want to talk about the pain last night.

Physician: Okay.

Physician: Is there anything else you can think of that you want to make sure we don't miss today?

Patient: No.

Physician: Okay. All right. Well, it sounds like the pain is a little bit more urgent right now. So, we'll start with the pain. We may get a little bit of a chance to talk about the incontinence as well. You know, that's a common problem. And we can also set up an appointment in the future to talk more about that. Does that sound okay?

Patient: Yeah.

Physician: Okay. Can you tell me a little bit more about the pain? Where it's located?

Physician: I just want to jump back to the pain now so I wouldn't get the whole story about that. Were there any other symptoms that you noticed at the same time as you had this pain?

Physician: So I just want to kind of summarize what you've told me so far since I jumped around a little bit and make sure that I got everything right. If anything's wrong, let me know for sure, or if we forgot anything.

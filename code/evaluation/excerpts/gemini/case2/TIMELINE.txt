Physician: "So, I just wanted to start by figuring out why you're here today."
Patient: "Well, I had an episode last night where I had really bad pain low in my belly."
Physician: "Okay. So you've had this pain that woke you up out of sleep this morning."
Physician: "Okay. All right. And you said the pain does radiate a little bit. It moves into your groin a little bit."
Physician: "Okay. Anything make the pain better?"
Physician: "Okay. And you said the pain does radiate a little bit. It moves into your groin a little bit."
Physician: "Okay. Anything make the pain better?"
Physician: "Okay. What did you try?"
Patient: "Well, when it woke me up, I got out of bed. I kind of paced around. I tried some Tylenol."
Physician: "And walking around didn't seem to do much either?"
Physician: "Okay. Does anything seem to make it worse?"
Physician: "Okay. All right. Are there any other medicines that you take on a regular basis?"
Physician: "Okay. All right. How many Tums do you take?"
Physician: "Okay. Well, that's kind of a lot. How come so many?"
Physician: "Have you been told that you had osteoporosis?"
Physician: "Okay. Anybody in your family have osteoporosis?"
Physician: "Okay. So more of a preventive sort of thing?"
Physician: "I just want to jump back to the pain now so I wouldn't get the whole story about that. Were there any other symptoms that you noticed at the same time as you had this pain?"
Physician: "Okay. Were you ever able to go?"
Physician: "Okay. All right. And was there anything unusual about the urine?"
Physician: "Okay. All right. And have you ever seen that kind of color of urine before?"
Physician: "Just a couple other questions about when you were having the pain. Did you ever feel any nausea?"
Physician: "Okay. Did you have any vomiting?"
Physician: "Okay. How about any changes in your bowels in the last few days or today?"
Physician: "Okay. All right. And it wasn't diarrhea?"
Physician: "About your menstrual history, are you currently having menses?"
Physician: "Okay. When was the last time?"
Physician: "Okay. All right. So it's been a while. Have you had any vaginal discharge at all?"
Physician: "Anything like that? All right. And have you had a fever that you know of?"
Physician: "About in terms of your diet, anything new in terms of your diet, eating more protein than normal or anything?"
Physician: "Okay. How about fluid intake? What do you normally drink during the day?"
Physician: "Okay. So maybe you've been drinking a little less than normal?"
Physician: "So you've had this pain that woke you up out of sleep this morning."
Physician: "And at the same time, you also had this feeling that you had to pee, and you tried to pee and weren't able to pass any urine until later this morning when you finally were able to pass some urine, but you noticed it was kind of a funny reddish color."
Physician: "And at the same time, you had some nausea, but no vomiting, and you haven't really had any other urinary symptoms. I'm not sure if I asked that. Have you had any pain with urinating?"
Physician: "Does that sound like a reasonable summary? Anything I missed?"
Physician: "Okay. So I just want to ask you some other questions about your medical history."
Physician: "Are there any medical problems that you're being treated for?"
Physician: "That's good. Have you been in the hospital at all?"
Physician: "Okay. All right. Were they normal vaginal births or something?"
Physician: "Okay. All right. And any surgeries?"
Physician: "Okay. How about medications? We already talked about the Tums that you're taking. You've taken some Tylenol. Do you take any other medicines?"
Physician: "Okay. All right. And do you have any allergies?"
Physician: "Okay. To medicines or foods?"
Physician: "Environmental allergies?"
Physician: "Now I just want to move on and ask you a little bit about your family history."
Physician: "Okay. Is there anything that runs in your family? Any kinds of diseases?"
Physician: "Okay. Has anyone in your family ever had renal failure or renal calculi that you know of?"
Physician: "I just want to ask you now some questions about your daily life just to get a better sense of what life is like for you and if any of that can have any impact on your problem today."
Physician: "Okay, that's great. Have you ever smoked?"
Physician: "How about alcohol? Do you drink alcohol?"
Physician: "Okay. How much do you think you normally drink?"
Physician: "Okay, all right. If you had to say number of times per week or per month, about how many times?"
Physician: "All right, so a pretty small amount. Okay. Have you ever done any other kinds of recreational drugs?"
Physician: "And just this is a question that we ask everyone and particularly with belly pain. Are you sexually active?"
Physician: "Okay. With?"
Physician: "Okay, all right. Any other partners?"
Physician: "Okay, all right. And have you had any pain with sexual intercourse?"
Physician: "And I understand that you've been having this really terrible pain and so I think we need to really figure out what's going on with that."
Physician: "And I also do want to address the incontinence a little bit later, but I think at this point it would be good for us to do physical exam, get some more information, and then after that we can talk and I'll tell you what I'm thinking about what what it might be and we can talk together about what our plan will be to go from here."
Physician: "Is there anything that you wanted to ask me? Any questions that you have?"
Physician: "Absolutely, absolutely. That makes perfect sense. It sounds like it was pretty scary, so I think that we're going to be able to come to a conclusion about what this is and give you some strategies for avoiding it in the future. Okay. All right, so I'm just going to give you a few minutes to change into your gown and I'll be right back."

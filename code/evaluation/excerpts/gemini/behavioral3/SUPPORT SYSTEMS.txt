Physician: "So you said that you lived alone. Where do you live?"
Patient: "I live here in Burlington."
Physician: "Okay. And is that a rural area? I'm not really familiar with it."
Patient:  "It's very much out in the country, yeah. It's a kind of a country, long, winding road that I live on. Mostly forest."
Physician: "Okay. And what do you do for a living?"
Patient: "I'm a landscaper. I plant trees and shrubs. I take care of trees and shrubs, and I do grass from the spring until the fall. I clean up people's yards. I prepare them."
Physician: "You must have a really nice yard yourself."
Patient: "It's simple, but nice, yes."
Physician: "Nice, nice. Okay. And so you mentioned your dad. Where does he live?"
Patient: "He lives about a mile and a half up the road from me."
Physician: "Okay. So the Zoloft is making you feel better, but when you are feeling kind of down, do you feel like you have a social support network?"
Patient: "Well, the guys I work with are really the guys who I know best, and we don't get together much after work occasionally. And I don't spend that much time with my father either. I'm really kind of a loner, I'd say."
Physician: "Okay. All right. Do you call your daughter once in a while at college?"
Patient: "I've spoken to her twice. She's called me. I don't feel like pestering her, and she sounds like she's having a good time, although it's just getting going."
Physician: "So have you thought about asking her for her old recipes or anything like that?"
Patient: "I've been thinking about that, but I just don't feel like calling her at college and asking her to tell me what to prepare for food."
Physician: "You mentioned that you were financially stable. Did you say if you had insurance?"
Patient: "I do."

Physician: So you're here to talk about how you can change that to make it a little bit more healthier for you.
Patient: That's exactly why I came.
Physician: Okay, good. So would you like to discuss making a change?
Patient: Please.

Physician: And this is something that I'd like to work with you together. We could make the appointment together. And then we can also have you make an appointment to see me and Dr. Smith in two weeks to see how, if you had the first appointment, how that went.
Patient: Okay. 
Physician: And also talk about maybe you've already enrolled in the class and how that's coming along.
Patient: Excellent.
Physician: But I really want you to feel like you can contact the office if you have any questions about nutrition or what you should be eating.
Patient: Very good. Thank you.

Physician: And Mr. Jones, you talked about the community health class, the adult education at the high school. And that should start up in two weeks, you said?
Patient: Yes.
Physician: Okay. Good. And what I can do is go talk to Dr. Smith and come back. And I can bring in a contract for you to sign that just says that you'll be willing to start up this new nutritional movement for you to feel better about yourself.
Patient: Good. 
Physician: And you could sign that, and that could just make it more official, and you could feel more motivated to do it, too.
Patient: Very good. I'd be happy to sign that. I'm feeling pretty motivated. Great. This conversation is getting me excited.

Physician: Well, I'm glad. I'm really glad that you're motivated to take the first step in eating healthfully, and that'll be really good for you, I'm sure.
Patient: Good. Thank you.

Physician: So that's pretty different than Cocoa Puffs and beef jerky, huh?

Physician: So you're here to talk about your eating habits and how to change them and make them better.

Physician: And so you said you don't drink, and you don't smoke, which is any recreational drugs?

Physician: But you're looking into how to cook, so maybe that's just a default way to make friends.

Physician: So, for example, you eat cereal with whole milk. Like, have you thought about trying 1% or 2% milk just to bring down the fat content a bit?

Physician: Well, I'm glad. I'm really glad that you're motivated to take the first step in eating healthfully, and that'll be really good for you, I'm sure.

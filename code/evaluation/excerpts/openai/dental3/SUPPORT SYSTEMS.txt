Physician: "And your wife is on you to quit also?"

Patient: "Well, yeah. I mean, she doesn't smoke, so naturally she would be, yeah, she is."

Physician: "And then also, very importantly, you have to have a support system in place, family, friends, coworkers. You've got to get people on board to help you because typically you can't do this alone."

Patient: "Sure, I've noticed."

Physician: "Do you have support?"

Patient: "Sure. I mean, you know, my wife doesn't smoke, so she's definitely going to be happy and helpful. The only thing, I mean, like I said, most of my friends and coworkers are smokers, but not all of them. So that might present a problem."

Physician: "Okay. Well, what might help, what usually helps people, is let other people know up front that you're trying to quit and you need their support. You're going to be irritable, you're going to be moody, especially during the first couple of weeks when your body's going through the nicotine withdrawal. So prepare people for that. You may be avoiding social situations where you're around other smokers. Let people know that in advance, that it's nothing personal. You're just trying to avoid temptation until you get through this critical period as your body's going through that withdrawal. So those are some suggestions."

Patient: "Yeah, I had not thought about that before when I tried, so that's why I would imagine it was pretty difficult."

Physician: "Some insurance plans do cover the cost of the medications and even the nicotine replacement products. Others don't. It's pretty variable, so you have to check with your specific insurance company. Generally speaking, for about a 12-week course of therapy, which is what's usually recommended, it's around $500, give or take. So actually, I don't think that's too bad considering the cost of cigarettes over the long term, and then obviously the health care costs associated with smoking throughout your lifetime."

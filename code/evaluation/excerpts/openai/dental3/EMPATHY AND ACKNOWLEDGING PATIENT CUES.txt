Physician: "Hey, Kevin. How's it going? It's really good to see you."

Physician: "That's fantastic. Congratulations."

Physician: "I've known you a long time, Kevin, so I have no doubt you're going to be a great dad. So that's just great news. Please make sure you give my congratulations to your wife."

Physician: "Oh, right. It sounds like you're doing a pretty good job, pretty reasonable job with your oral hygiene."

Physician: "That's great. That's fantastic."

Physician: "Well, that's great."

Physician: "Okay. Well, actually, that's a really good thing. You know, quitting smoking is probably the best thing you could do for your health."

Physician: "It sounds like you might be at that point."

Physician: "Okay. Well, you know, you shouldn't really be too hard on yourself because typically people who try to quit smoking are not successful on their first attempt. It often takes them several attempts before they finally do quit. The important thing is that you've tried, and it sounds like you're still really interested, that you're very motivated."

Physician: "Okay. That's great because that would give you some time to prepare."

Physician: "That tells everybody up front that I'm going through this potentially difficult time. Be nice to me."

Physician: "Either myself or anyone in the office will certainly be willing to help you in whatever way we can."

Physician: "All right, all right, terrific. Dorothy should be in shortly to do your prophy, and maybe, hopefully, this will be the last time she's removing tobacco stains from your teeth."

Physician: "Okay. That would be great. Terrific. So then I'll see you at the end of the prophy visit to check your mouth."

Physician: "Okay, all right. So then what I'll do is I'll plan on calling you, say, within a couple of days."
Patient: "Okay."
Physician: "After your actual quit date, which you said is going to be two weeks from this Saturday. From this Saturday."
Patient: "right."
Physician: "Okay."
Patient: "Make it a weekend."
Physician: "All right, great. Unless I hear from you before then, if you have any questions. Sure, sure. As we talked about. Does that sound okay?"
Patient: "Sounds great."
Physician: "All right, all right, terrific. Dorothy should be in shortly to do your prophy, and maybe, hopefully, this will be the last time she's removing tobacco stains from your teeth."
Patient: "Yeah, that would be great."
Physician: "Okay. That would be great. Terrific. So then I'll see you at the end of the prophy visit to check your mouth."
Patient: "Great, thank you so much. I really appreciate it."
Physician: "Sounds good."

Physician: "Okay, and do you think your boss would be okay with you taking some time off if you needed to?"

Physician: "Okay, I'll see if I can do that for you."

Physician: "Okay. And do you have any family or friends in the area?"

Patient: "My family lives about 45 minutes away."

Physician: "Okay. And do you have any friends or significant other?"

Patient: "My girlfriend lives in town."

Physician: "Okay. So do you think that you could look to your girlfriend in a time of need for her to help you out if you were sick or anything like that?"

Patient: "Yeah. I've been keeping her updated when she was over and helped me cook. So that stuff's okay. I'm just worried about when I go back to work."

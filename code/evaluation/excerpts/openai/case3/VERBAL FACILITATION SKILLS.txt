Physician: "Nice to meet you, Dan. Is that how you'd like to be addressed today?"

Physician: "Oh, I'm really sorry to hear about that. Can you tell me a little bit about that?"

Physician: "Okay, I'll see if I can do that for you."

Physician: "So I'd just like to summarize a little bit. So it sounds like you've had chest pain for two days now. Sometimes it's an ache, sometimes it's sharp. It's made worse if you're lifting things and you're worried because at work you lift boxes. It's made better by Advil. You said you've taken like two in the morning, two in the afternoon. That seems to help. You're not sure what the dose is on that. And it doesn't radiate anywhere. You have no other symptoms with that. Does that sound about right?"

Physician: "Okay. So just to summarize your past medical history, it sounds like you're pretty healthy. You just have seasonal allergies in the fall. And you said you take Flonase for that?"

Physician: "Okay. So it sounds like there's a possibility that your chest pain could be related to the mountain biking incident. And I will talk with my doctor and you can wait here. I'll be back in a few minutes."

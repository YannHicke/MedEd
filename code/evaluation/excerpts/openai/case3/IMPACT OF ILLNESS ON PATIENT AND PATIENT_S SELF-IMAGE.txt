Physician: "Past few days, I've just been not moving and being low-key with it, seeing if it get better, but I'm gonna have to go back to work in a couple days and I do a lot of lifting for my job and I'm worried if that's gonna interfere with that or if it's my heart, it might make it worse."

Physician: "Okay, and do you think your boss would be okay with you taking some time off if you needed to?"

Patient: "Sure, if I get a doctor's note."

Physician: "Okay, so do you think that you could look to your girlfriend in a time of need for her to help you out if you were sick or anything like that?"

Patient: "Yeah. I've been keeping her updated when she was over and helped me cook. So that stuff's okay. I'm just worried about when I go back to work."

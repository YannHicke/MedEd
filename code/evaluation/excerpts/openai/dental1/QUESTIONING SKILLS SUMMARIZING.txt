Physician: "Okay. Alright. So just so I've got an idea, you're feeling like you have some abscesses in your mouth and they are on both sides on the lower."

Physician: "And it's been about 10 days, but you had some mercury fillings, some probably amalgam, are they silver-colored?"

Physician: "Silver-colored fillings in the past and you think that might be the cause and you had those removed about two years ago, is that correct?"

Physician: "So you feel like you've had dental work in the past pretty much on a regular basis. Is that correct?"

Physician: "And just you were in a car, and you're feeling like as soon as you had the new car, certain health problems were starting to happen. Is that correct?"

Physician: "All right, and so do you think the problems with your teeth, you think they're related to chemical sensitivities? Is that my understanding?"

Physician: "Okay. Yeah, I will take a look at this later a little bit. So you think it's just some chemical sensitivities to your teeth, and that's why you had the amalgam fillings removed then. Is that correct?"

Physician: "So I think I have a good idea about medical history a little bit."

Physician: "All right. I think I have a fairly good idea of medical history and dental history."

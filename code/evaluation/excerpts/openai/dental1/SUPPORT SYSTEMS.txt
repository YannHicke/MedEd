Physician: "Do you live with your mom, or does she live close by?"
Patient: "I live with her."
Physician: "You live with her. Okay. So do you have a little bit of family support then at home?"
Patient: "Well, she's 78, and the diabetes really affects her. So, I mean, it's more about her than it is about me at this point."

Physician: "What about transportation? Is transportation going to be a problem or not?"
Patient: "Well, I can't take public transportation. I don't know what I'm going to be exposed to with that."
Physician: "Okay."
Patient: "So I have friends drive me."
Physician: "Okay. So you would be able to come if a friend could drive you?"
Patient: "Yeah. My mom absolutely can't."

Physician: "And do you â€“ I know you used to mention you were a nurse. Do you work at all now or no?"
Patient: "No. No. I'm on permanent disability now."
Physician: "Okay. So timeframes for the appointments wouldn't be too much of a problem then?"
Patient: "As long as I could get a ride, yeah."

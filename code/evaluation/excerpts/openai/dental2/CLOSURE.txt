Physician: "So do you have any other questions for me today?"

Patient: "I think you pretty much explained."

Physician: "Okay."

Patient: "But I'd like to know after, I mean, examine, like how many visits should I come if I decide to take the deep cleaning or whatever treatment?"

Physician: "Sure. So I'm just going to tell you what our overall plan is. What we're going to do is we'll, I think we have time now, we're going to do a complete periodontal exam on you."

Patient: "Okay."

Physician: "At that time, we'll be able to tell exactly how many visits you need to come in for."

Patient: "Mm-hmm. You're going to need one visit for a general cleaning."

Patient: "Okay."

Physician: "And then one visit for each quadrant that we decide you need a deep cleaning on."

Patient: "Okay."

Physician: "That can be between anywhere from one to four visits."

Patient: "Okay."

Physician: "Okay? So the most amount of visits that we're looking at is five."

Patient: "Mm-hmm."

Physician: "The least amount is one."

Patient: "Okay."

Physician: "But the number probably lies somewhere in between."

Patient: "Mm-hmm."

Physician: "So we'll be able to tell you that at the end of today's visit."

Patient: "Okay, excellent."

Physician: "Excellent. Do you have any other questions for me?"

Patient: "No."

Physician: "Okay, great. It was a pleasure to meet you."

Patient: "Yeah. Thank you very much."

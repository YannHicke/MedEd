Physician: "So tell me why you want to start an exercise program."

Patient: "Well, I've been tired for the last almost year. You know, it seems to be getting progressively worse, so I don't know if it'll help, but I'm hoping it will."

Physician: "Let's see. Is there anything that you think would stop you from exercising? Anything that you're worried about?"

Patient: "Well, I'm kind of leery of going to a gym, although I guess they have the best facility. But since I have the problems and I just don't want to be in a bathing suit, I have horrendous varicose veins, which don't look too nice. So it's kind of making me â€“ I mean, I will do it probably, but it's going to be hard to get into."

Physician: "Is there anything that's particularly stressful in your life? Is there something that you worry about? Sometimes stressors can have an effect on people's habits, like eating and exercise and all that."

Patient: "Well, my biggest stress is my mom. She's still in the nursing home. She's been there 30 years."

Physician: "Wow."

Patient: "And she's getting progressively worse."

Physician: "What is she ill with?"

Patient: "Arthritis. She's crumpled up because of the arthritis."

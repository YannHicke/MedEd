Physician: "Okay. Nice to meet you. I'm a second-year medical student. I understand you've come in today because you're interested in quitting smoking. Is that correct?"

Physician: "Okay. So besides your concern about quitting smoking, do you have any other things that you would like to speak about today?"

Patient: "No. That was pretty much it."

Physician: "All right. If anything comes up, you can just stop me or just remember for later. Sound good?"

Physician: "Do you have any questions at this time or any other concerns you've thought of?"

Patient: "No. You already mentioned it. I was concerned about how much the medication would cost. I don't know how much it cost my parents because they had good insurance."

Physician: "Any questions? Any other concerns?"

Patient: "No. Right now, I don't have any questions."

Physician: "Any questions? Any other concerns?"

Patient: "Well, the only question I have is I don't know much about the medication."

Physician: "Any questions in the end, or is this any other concerns?"

Patient: "Well, the question I had, I guess you might have mentioned it, is I was concerned about gaining weight when I stopped smoking. I know that's happened to some people. And, you know, I was also worried about what would happen if this didn't work. I mean, because if this doesn't work, then what am I going to do? So, I mean, I'm just hoping that it will. But, you know, in the back of my mind, I was a little bit worried."

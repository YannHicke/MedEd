Physician: "Okay, so I feel like we've gotten a pretty good sense today of the different symptoms that you've been having and I understand that you've been having this really terrible pain and so I think we need to really figure out what's going on with that. And I also do want to address the incontinence a little bit later, but I think at this point it would be good for us to do physical exam, get some more information, and then after that we can talk and I'll tell you what I'm thinking about what what it might be and we can talk together about what our plan will be to go from here. Does that sound okay?"
Patient: "Sounds great."
Physician: "Okay. Is there anything that you wanted to ask me? Any questions that you have?"
Patient: "No, I just want to know if there's any, you know, what happened last night and if there's anything I could do so to prevent it from happening again."
Physician: "Absolutely, absolutely. That makes perfect sense. It sounds like it was pretty scary, so I think that we're going to be able to come to a conclusion about what this is and give you some strategies for avoiding it in the future. Okay. All right, so I'm just going to give you a few minutes to change into your gown and I'll be right back."
Patient: "Okay."
Physician: "All right. Thank you very much. Nice to meet you."

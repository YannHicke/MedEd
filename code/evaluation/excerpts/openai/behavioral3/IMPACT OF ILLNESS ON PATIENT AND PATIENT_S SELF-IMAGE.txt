Physician: So before I continue with talking about food and everything, why don't you tell me a little bit about yourself? How is your health?

Physician: So the Zoloft is making you feel better, but when you are feeling kind of down, do you feel like you have a social support network?

Physician: And that would also be a really good way for you to meet people and to get more integrated into your community, since you said you're kind of lonely out in the rural Burlington area.

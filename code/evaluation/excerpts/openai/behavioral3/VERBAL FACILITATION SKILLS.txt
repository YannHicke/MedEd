Physician: "Nice. Cool. That's great. Thank you. Good for her."

Physician: "Okay. Great. Well, that's wonderful. I'm glad to hear that."

Physician: "That's good."

Physician: "Oh, I'm sorry to hear that."

Physician: "Okay. That's great. That's really good."

Physician: "Oh, well, great."

Physician: "That's great. That's really good."

Physician: "Nice, nice."

Physician: "Okay. Good. So would you like to discuss making a change?"

Physician: "Okay, great. Absolutely."

Physician: "Okay, that's good."

Physician: "Oh, great. How convenient. That's great."

Physician: "Oh, wonderful. So is that something you'd be willing to enroll in?"

Physician: "And that would also be a really good way for you to meet people and to get more integrated into your community, since you said you're kind of lonely out in the rural Burlington area."

Physician: "But you're looking into how to cook, so maybe that's just a default way to make friends."

Physician: "That's a good idea. I like that."

Physician: "That's great. I'm glad."

Physician: "Okay. So we'll establish the appointment for the dietician."

Physician: "And this is something that I'd like to work with you together."

Physician: "But I really want you to feel like you can contact the office if you have any questions about nutrition or what you should be eating."

Physician: "Okay. Great."

Physician: "Okay. Good."

Physician: "Oh, I'm good. I'm glad. I'm glad."

Physician: "Okay. Well, there's something you can do right now before seeing a dietician."

Physician: "Well, I'm glad. I'm really glad that you're motivated to take the first step in eating healthfully, and that'll be really good for you, I'm sure."

Physician: "So I'm going to go talk to Dr. Smith and get you that paperwork, and you just stay right here, and I'll come back."

Physician: "All right? Very nice talking to you, Mr. Jones."

Physician: "Thank you."

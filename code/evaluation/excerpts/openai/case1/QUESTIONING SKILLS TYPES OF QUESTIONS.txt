Physician: "So what brings you in today?"

Physician: "Can you start from the beginning and really tell me everything you can remember about when it started?"

Physician: "And where was it?"

Physician: "And did it move anywhere?"

Physician: "Anything you did to try to help it?"

Physician: "What did you do then? What happened next?"

Physician: "Okay. How long did the pain last?"

Physician: "Iâ€™m assuming you don't have it now."

Physician: "Was there anything different about the urine that came out?"

Physician: "Is that something that you've seen before?"

Physician: "And while this was going on, while the pain was going on, was it constant? Did it come and go, or was it really constant for those hours?"

Physician: "Any other symptoms that you felt at the same time?"

Physician: "And did those symptoms last throughout with the pain as well, or did they come and go?"

Physician: "Have you had any changes in your bowels?"

Physician: "Like diarrhea, constipation?"

Physician: "And do you still get your menses?"

Physician: "And how long has it been since you got your period?"

Physician: "And did you have any vomiting?"

Physician: "And along with the sensation of having to pee and not being able to pee, was there any pain when you were able to pee?"

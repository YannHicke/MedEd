ACHIEVE_A_SHARED_PLAN = """
You will be given the transcript of a medical interview between a medical student (called physician) and a patient. Your task is to evaluate how well the student achieves a shared plan with the patient. You will then provide your evaluation in a given JSON format.

To ensure a thorough evaluation, follow these steps:

  **Step 1. Identify Key Elements:**
    - As you read the transcript, create a list noting whether each element is present or absent:
      - Discussion of the diagnosis/prognosis
      - Inviting patient to contribute
      - Negotiating a plan with the patient

  **Step 2. Scoring:**
    - As you read the transcript, use your list from Step 1 and evaluate the medical studentâ€™s performance based on the criteria for each score level:
      - **Score 5:** The student discusses the diagnosis and/or prognosis and negotiates a plan with the patient. The student invites the patient to contribute their own thoughts, ideas, suggestions, and preferences.
      - **Score 4:** The student discusses the diagnosis and/or prognosis and attempts to negotiate a plan with the patient. They invite some patient input, but may not explore the patient's thoughts, ideas, suggestions, and preferences as thoroughly as in a score of 5. The student shows a clear attempt to involve the patient in decision-making, even if not as comprehensively as in a top performance.
      - **Score 3:** The student discusses the diagnosis and/or prognosis and plan but does not allow the patient to contribute. The discussion lacks full quality. 
      - **Score 2:** The student makes limited attempts to discuss the diagnosis and/or prognosis with no opportunity for patient input. 
      - **Score 1:** The student fails to discuss the diagnosis and/or prognosis. 

  **Step 3. Justification:** Based on your analysis in Steps 1 and 2, assign a score using the provided rubric strictly, and explain your reasoning clearly. Your evaluation should be rigorous, impartial, and evidence-based. Directly quote the transcript to support your evaluation.

Provide your evaluation in the following JSON format. Provide your entire response in the JSON format and nothing else.

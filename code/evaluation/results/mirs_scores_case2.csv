OPENING,5,"The conversation includes a self-introduction ('My name is Amy'), role clarification ('I'm a medical student working with the doctors here today'), and a polite inquiry about how to address the patient ('Is Mrs. Paulton how you'd like to be addressed?'). All three elements are present, making it a complete introduction."
ELICITS SPECTRUM OF CONCERNS,5,"The physician begins by asking if there is anything else the patient wants to address before discussing the main concern: 'Is there anything else that you want to make sure we address today before we talk more about that pain?' The patient mentions another concern: 'Well, I guess the other thing is every once in a while I feel like I'm leaking urine.' The physician then follows up with another prompt: 'Is there anything else you can think of that you want to make sure we don't miss today?' The patient responds with 'No.' This sequence shows that the physician effectively elicited the patient's full spectrum of concerns by asking 'what else' until no additional concerns were raised."
NEGOTIATES PRIORITIES & SETS AGENDA,N/A,"{
  ""explanation"": ""The physician acknowledges the patient's pain as the primary concern and mentions the incontinence issue as well. The physician states, 'So, we'll start with the pain. We may get a little bit of a chance to talk about the incontinence as well.' This indicates an attempt to set an agenda by prioritizing the pain and potentially addressing the incontinence if time permits. However, the physician does not fully negotiate the priorities with the patient or list all concerns comprehensively. The physician does get the patient's agreement to the proposed plan by asking, 'Does that sound okay?' and receiving a 'Yeah' in response. Therefore, the physician sets an agenda but does not fully negotiate priorities with the patient."",

ELICITING THE NARRATIVE THREAD or the ‘PATIENT’S STORY’,N/A,"{
  ""explanation"": ""The physician in this conversation demonstrates a mix of allowing the patient to talk and interjecting with focused questions. The physician starts by asking open-ended questions such as, 'Can you tell me a little bit more about the pain? Where it's located?' and 'Is there anything else that you want to make sure we address today before we talk more about that pain?' These questions encourage the patient to share their story. However, the physician frequently interrupts the patient's narrative with specific questions, such as 'If you had to qualify it or quantify it on a scale where zero is no pain and ten is the worst thing ever, where would you put it?' and 'How much Tylenol did you take?' This sets a Q&A style rather than a conversational flow. The physician does summarize the patient's story towards the end, which shows an effort to understand the patient's situation comprehensively. Overall, the physician allows the patient to talk but often interrupts with focused questions, which aligns with a score of 3."",

TIMELINE,5,"The physician does a thorough job of establishing a timeline and chronology of the patient's chief concern and history of the present illness. The conversation starts with the physician asking about the location and nature of the pain: 'Can you tell me a little bit more about the pain? Where it's located?' and 'What kind of pain was it?' The physician then inquires about the onset and progression of the pain: 'Did it move anywhere?' and 'If you had to qualify it or quantify it on a scale where zero is no pain and ten is the worst thing ever, where would you put it?' The physician also asks about the effectiveness of any interventions: 'Anything make the pain better?' and 'What did you try?' The physician further explores associated symptoms and their sequence: 'Were there any other symptoms that you noticed at the same time as you had this pain?' and 'So I just want to kind of summarize what you've told me so far since I jumped around a little bit and make sure that I got everything right.' The physician also confirms the patient's urinary symptoms and their timeline: 'And at the same time, you also had this feeling that you had to pee, and you tried to pee and weren't able to pass any urine until later this morning when you finally were able to pass some urine, but you noticed it was kind of a funny reddish color.' The physician's detailed questioning and summarization ensure a clear chronology of the patient's symptoms and events, warranting a score of 5."
ORGANIZATION,5,"The physician's organization of the interview is quite logical and follows a clear structure. The physician starts by acknowledging the urgency of the patient's pain and prioritizes it: 'Well, it sounds like the pain is a little bit more urgent right now. So, we'll start with the pain.' This shows a clear prioritization of the patient's immediate concern. The physician then seeks to gather more information about the pain: 'Were there any other symptoms that you noticed at the same time as you had this pain?' This is a logical follow-up to understand the context of the pain better. The physician also summarizes the information gathered to ensure accuracy: 'I just want to kind of summarize what you've told me so far since I jumped around a little bit and make sure that I got everything right.' Finally, the physician outlines the next steps clearly: 'I think at this point it would be good for us to do physical exam, get some more information, and then after that we can talk and I'll tell you what I'm thinking about what it might be and we can talk together about what our plan will be to go from here.' This structured approach ensures that the interview is organized and that the patient knows what to expect next. Overall, the questions follow a logical order, and the time is used effectively to address the patient's concerns."
PACING OF INTERVIEW,5,"The physician in this conversation demonstrates a high level of attentiveness and allows the patient to fully express their concerns without interruption. The interview progresses smoothly, with the physician asking follow-up questions that naturally flow from the patient's responses. For example, the physician asks, 'Can you tell me a little bit more about the pain? Where it's located?' and then follows up with, 'Did it move anywhere?' This shows a logical progression in the questioning. Additionally, the physician uses silence effectively, giving the patient time to respond fully before moving on to the next question. There are no awkward pauses or interruptions that disrupt the flow of the conversation. The physician also summarizes the patient's information to ensure understanding, saying, 'Okay. So you've had this pain that woke you up out of sleep this morning...' This summary helps to maintain the smooth progression of the interview."
QUESTIONING SKILLS – TYPES OF QUESTIONS,3,"The physician begins the conversation with an open-ended question: 'So, I just wanted to start by figuring out why you're here today.' This is a good start as it allows the patient to provide a broad overview of their concerns. However, the physician quickly moves to more specific questions without consistently returning to open-ended questions to start new lines of inquiry. For example, 'Can you tell me a little bit more about the pain? Where it's located?' is a specific question that follows the initial open-ended question. The physician continues with specific questions such as 'Did it move anywhere?' and 'What kind of pain was it?' without reintroducing open-ended questions to explore new topics. Additionally, the physician uses multiple questions in a single turn, such as 'Have you ever had a pain like that before? If you had to qualify it or quantify it on a scale where zero is no pain and ten is the worst thing ever, where would you put it?' This can be overwhelming for the patient and may detract from the quality of information gathered. The physician also uses leading questions, such as 'But that didn't seem to do much?' and 'And walking around didn't seem to do much either?' which can bias the patient's responses. Overall, while the physician does use some open-ended questions, the frequent use of specific, multiple, and leading questions detracts from the quality of information gathered."
QUESTIONING SKILLS - SUMMARIZING,5,"The physician provides a detailed summary of the patient's symptoms, including the severity and nature of the pain, its location, the patient's attempts to alleviate it, associated urinary symptoms, and nausea. The physician states, 'So you've had this pain that woke you up out of sleep this morning. It was really severe, tearing pain in your right side, about a 10 out of 10, really one of the worst pains you've ever had. Moves into your groin a little bit, and you tried to walk around, took some Tylenol, nothing really helped to make it any better. And at the same time, you also had this feeling that you had to pee, and you tried to pee and weren't able to pass any urine until later this morning when you finally were able to pass some urine, but you noticed it was kind of a funny reddish color. And at the same time, you had some nausea, but no vomiting, and you haven't really had any other urinary symptoms.' This comprehensive summary ensures that the physician has captured all relevant information and provides an opportunity for the patient to correct or add details. The physician also follows up with a clarifying question about pain with urination, demonstrating thoroughness."
QUESTIONING SKILLS - DUPLICATION,5,No questions were duplicated.
QUESTIONING SKILLS - LACK OF JARGON,5,"The physician in this conversation consistently uses language that is easily understood by the patient and avoids medical jargon. For example, the physician asks, 'If you had to qualify it or quantify it on a scale where zero is no pain and ten is the worst thing ever, where would you put it?' This is a clear and straightforward way to assess pain without using technical terms. Additionally, the physician says, 'Okay. Extra strength or regular?' when discussing medication, which is simple and clear. The physician also avoids jargon when summarizing the patient's symptoms and discussing the plan: 'I think we need to really figure out what's going on with that. And I also do want to address the incontinence a little bit later.' Overall, the physician's communication is clear and accessible, making it easy for the patient to understand."
QUESTIONING SKILLS - VERIFICATION OF PATIENT INFORMATION (in vignette),5,"The physician in this conversation consistently seeks to clarify, verify, and specify the patient's responses, ensuring accurate understanding. For example, the physician asks, 'Can you tell me a little bit more about the pain? Where it's located?' and follows up with 'Did it move anywhere?' and 'What kind of pain was it?' These questions help to clarify the nature and location of the pain. The physician also verifies the patient's actions and their effects, such as 'Anything make the pain better?' and 'What did you try?' Additionally, the physician seeks specificity in the patient's medication usage by asking, 'How much Tylenol did you take?' and 'Extra strength or regular?' The physician also ensures understanding of the patient's symptoms and history by asking detailed questions about other symptoms, family history, and lifestyle factors, such as 'Were there any other symptoms that you noticed at the same time as you had this pain?' and 'Do you smoke at all?' Overall, the physician's approach is thorough and methodical, consistently seeking to clarify, verify, and specify the patient's responses."
VERBAL FACILITATION SKILLS,5,"The physician in this conversation demonstrates a consistent use of verbal encouragement and facilitation skills to engage the patient. The physician acknowledges the patient's feelings multiple times, such as saying, 'That must have been scary,' and 'Absolutely, absolutely. That makes perfect sense. It sounds like it was pretty scary.' These statements show empathy and understanding, which can help the patient feel more comfortable and open. The physician also uses facilitative language to guide the conversation, such as, 'Okay, good. Well, I think I have a pretty good picture of what happened,' and 'Does that sound okay?' These phrases help to draw out more information from the patient and ensure that the patient feels involved in the decision-making process. Additionally, the physician provides a clear plan and next steps, which can help the patient feel more at ease: 'I think at this point it would be good for us to do a physical exam, get some more information, and then after that we can talk and I'll tell you what I'm thinking about what it might be and we can talk together about what our plan will be to go from here.' Overall, the physician's consistent use of verbal encouragement and facilitation skills warrants a high score."
EMPATHY AND ACKNOWLEDGING PATIENT CUES,3,"The physician makes several attempts to acknowledge the patient's emotions, but the execution is somewhat repetitive and lacks depth. For instance, the physician says, 'That must have been scary,' twice, which shows an attempt to name the emotion but does not fully engage with the patient's experience. The statement, 'Absolutely, absolutely. That makes perfect sense. It sounds like it was pretty scary,' again acknowledges the emotion but does not delve deeper into understanding or supporting the patient. The physician does not use the full NURS technique (name, understand, respect, support) effectively. While the physician is not negative or dismissive, the empathy shown is somewhat superficial and repetitive, rather than deeply supportive."
PATIENT’S PERSPECTIVE (BELIEFS; Case specific),1,"The physician in this conversation does not explicitly elicit the patient's perspective on the illness, including their beliefs about its beginning, feelings, ideas of cause, function, and expectations (FIFE). The physician does ask some questions about the patient's symptoms and medical history, but there is no direct effort to understand the patient's own beliefs or ideas about what might be causing their symptoms. For example, the physician says, 'I think we need to really figure out what's going on with that,' but does not ask the patient what they think might be causing the pain or incontinence. Additionally, the patient expresses a desire to know what happened last night and how to prevent it in the future, but the physician responds with, 'I think that we're going to be able to come to a conclusion about what this is and give you some strategies for avoiding it in the future,' without further exploring the patient's own thoughts or concerns. Therefore, the physician fails to elicit the patient's perspective, resulting in a low score."
IMPACT OF ILLNESS ON PATIENT AND PATIENT’S SELF-IMAGE,N/A,N/A
ACHIEVE A SHARED PLAN,1,"The physician in this conversation does not discuss the diagnosis or prognosis explicitly. The physician mentions that they will address the incontinence later and suggests doing a physical exam to gather more information before discussing what the issue might be and planning the next steps. The physician says, 'I think at this point it would be good for us to do physical exam, get some more information, and then after that we can talk and I'll tell you what I'm thinking about what what it might be and we can talk together about what our plan will be to go from here.' This indicates an intention to discuss the diagnosis and plan but does not actually do so within the provided conversation. Therefore, the conversation lacks the discussion of diagnosis or prognosis and the negotiation of a plan with the patient."
ENCOURAGEMENT OF QUESTIONS,5,"The physician provides multiple opportunities for the patient to ask questions or bring up additional topics. The first opportunity is given with the question, 'Is there anything else that you want to make sure we address today before we talk more about that pain?' This is followed by another opportunity with, 'Is there anything else you can think of that you want to make sure we don't miss today?' The physician also checks for understanding and completeness with, 'Does that sound like a reasonable summary? Anything I missed?' Finally, the physician explicitly asks, 'Is there anything that you wanted to ask me? Any questions that you have?' This ensures that the patient has ample opportunity to bring up any concerns or questions, meeting the criteria for a high score."
SUPPORT SYSTEMS,1,"The physician did not discuss any aspects of the patient's support systems, including emotional, financial support, or access to healthcare. There were no questions or comments made to determine what support the patient currently has or might need. Therefore, the physician failed to address any support currently available to the patient."
PATIENT’S EDUCATION & UNDERSTANDING,2,"The physician does not explicitly determine the patient's level of interest in education, nor do they provide detailed educational information or use the teach back technique. The physician acknowledges the patient's concerns and expresses a willingness to address them, but there is no evidence of checking for understanding or providing specific educational content. For example, the physician says, 'Absolutely, absolutely. That makes perfect sense. It sounds like it was pretty scary, so I think that we're going to be able to come to a conclusion about what this is and give you some strategies for avoiding it in the future.' However, there is no follow-up to ensure the patient understands or to provide detailed strategies at this point."
ASSESS MOTIVATION FOR CHANGES,N/A,N/A
CLOSURE,3,"The physician does provide some information about the next steps, but it is not very detailed. The physician mentions, 'I think at this point it would be good for us to do physical exam, get some more information, and then after that we can talk and I'll tell you what I'm thinking about what it might be and we can talk together about what our plan will be to go from here.' This indicates that there will be a physical exam followed by a discussion, but it lacks specifics about what the patient should do in the meantime or any concrete future plans. The physician also says, 'I'm just going to give you a few minutes to change into your gown and I'll be right back,' which is clear but only pertains to the immediate next step. There is no mention of any follow-up appointments, referrals, or specific actions the patient should take after the visit. Therefore, the plan is only partially detailed."

OPENING,4,"The physician introduces herself by saying, 'I'm Kylie Haynes.' This covers the self-introduction. She also clarifies her role by stating, 'I'm going to be taking a look today.' However, the physician does not make a polite inquiry about how to address the patient by name. Instead, she assumes the patient's name is Ms. Austin without confirming it. Therefore, the introduction is missing the polite patient address inquiry."
ELICITS SPECTRUM OF CONCERNS,3,"The physician begins by asking the patient what brought them in today, which is a good start to elicit the patient's main concern: 'So what brought you here today?' The patient mentions soreness and potential abscesses, and the physician follows up with questions to understand the pain better: 'Can you describe the pain to me a little bit?' and 'How long is the pain, like the duration of the pain?' The physician also asks about the history of the problem: 'Have you had any problems with it before this or it's just started at 10 days, 10 days ago?' However, the physician does not ask if there are any other concerns or symptoms the patient might be experiencing. The conversation focuses solely on the main concern without probing for additional issues. Therefore, the physician elicits the main concern but does not fully explore the patient's full spectrum of concerns."
NEGOTIATES PRIORITIES & SETS AGENDA,3,"The physician begins by explaining the plan for the visit: 'So probably what the plan is going to be is that I'm going to ask you a few questions. They'll probably be dental-related and medical-related just so we can kind of get an idea of what's going on. And then we'll probably just do an exam, take a look in your mouth, and see what we can do and kind of make a plan for you. Does that sound good?' This sets a general agenda but does not elicit all patient concerns or negotiate priorities. The physician focuses on the chief concern, 'So what brought you here today?' and continues to gather detailed information about the patient's dental and medical history. However, there is no explicit negotiation of priorities or comprehensive agenda setting based on all patient concerns. Therefore, the physician sets an agenda but does not negotiate priorities with the patient."
ELICITING THE NARRATIVE THREAD or the ‘PATIENT’S STORY’,3,"The physician in this conversation generally allows the patient to talk but occasionally interrupts with focused questions. For example, the physician asks, 'Can you describe the pain to me a little bit?' and then follows up with 'How long is the pain, like the duration of the pain?' These questions are relevant and help gather necessary information, but they do interrupt the patient's narrative. Additionally, the physician often interjects with clarifying questions such as 'Have you had any problems with it before this or it's just started at 10 days, 10 days ago?' and 'And it's been about 10 days, but you had some mercury fillings, some probably amalgam, are they silver-colored?' While these interruptions are aimed at gathering detailed information, they do disrupt the flow of the patient's story. Therefore, the physician's approach aligns with a score of 3, as they generally allow the patient to talk but occasionally interrupt with focused questions."
TIMELINE,3,"The physician does a good job of obtaining some necessary information to establish a timeline of the patient's chief concern and history of the present illness. The physician asks about the duration of the pain: 'How long is the pain, like the duration of the pain?' and clarifies the timeline: 'It's been about 10 days?' The patient confirms: 'Yeah. I didn't really want to do anything about it, but at this point I know I have to.' The physician also inquires about any previous related issues: 'Have you had any problems with it before this or it's just started at 10 days, 10 days ago?' and the patient provides additional context about past dental work: 'Well, I had some mercury fillings that I had taken out about two years ago.' However, the physician does not delve deeply into the sequence of symptoms or events over the 10-day period, nor does the physician ask about any changes in the intensity or nature of the pain over time. Therefore, while some chronology is established, it is not complete."
ORGANIZATION,N/A,"{
  ""explanation"": ""The physician's interview is well-organized and follows a logical order, ensuring that all relevant topics are covered systematically. The physician starts by explaining the plan and then moves on to the patient's chief complaint: 'So what brought you here today?' This is followed by detailed questions about the duration and nature of the pain: 'How long is the pain, like the duration of the pain?' and 'Kind of just describe a little bit to me.' The physician then explores the patient's dental history, asking about past dental work and the reason for removing the amalgam fillings: 'Why did you have the fillings removed? What do you think was the problem?' 

The physician transitions smoothly into the patient's medical history, asking about significant medical problems: 'What are some of the significant medical problems that you have?' and 'How often do you have to use it?' The physician also inquires about family support and living arrangements: 'Do you live with your mom, or does she live close by?' 

Finally, the physician discusses the next steps, including taking x-rays and ensuring the patient is comfortable with the materials used: 'We'll go out and get everything ready. We'll probably take a couple pictures of your teeth, x-rays. Is that all right, to take some x-rays of your teeth?' 

Overall, the questions follow a logical order, and the physician effectively uses the time to cover all necessary topics, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the patient's condition and concerns."",

PACING OF INTERVIEW,5,"The interviewer demonstrates a high level of attentiveness throughout the conversation. The physician listens to the patient's responses without interrupting and asks follow-up questions that are relevant to the patient's concerns. For example, when the patient mentions, 'I have a lot of soreness right here. I think it's abscessed,' the physician responds with, 'Okay. Can you describe the pain to me a little bit?' This shows that the physician is paying attention and seeking more detailed information. Additionally, the interview progresses smoothly without any noticeable awkward pauses. The physician also uses silence effectively, allowing the patient to fully express their concerns before moving on to the next question. Overall, the pacing of the interview is comfortable and deliberate, ensuring that the patient feels heard and understood."
QUESTIONING SKILLS – TYPES OF QUESTIONS,N/A,"{
  ""explanation"": ""The physician begins the conversation with an open-ended question: 'So what brought you here today?' This is a good start as it allows the patient to provide a broad overview of their concerns. However, the physician quickly shifts to more specific questions without consistently returning to open-ended questions to start new lines of inquiry. For example, 'Can you describe the pain to me a little bit?' is a specific question that follows the initial open-ended question. The physician continues with specific questions like 'How long is the pain, like the duration of the pain?' and 'Have you had any problems with it before this or it's just started at 10 days, 10 days ago?' 

  The physician does not use leading questions or multiple questions, which is positive. However, the sequence of questions often lacks the open-ended approach that would allow the patient to provide more detailed and nuanced information. For instance, instead of asking 'What kind of dental work have you had in the past? Just the wisdom teeth and a few fillings, is that about it?' a more open-ended question like 'Can you tell me about your dental history?' would have been more appropriate.

  The physician also uses some 'why' questions, such as 'Why did you have the fillings removed? What do you think was the problem?' which can sometimes make patients feel defensive or unsure how to answer.

  Overall, while the physician does gather a lot of specific information, the approach could be improved by consistently starting new lines of inquiry with open-ended questions and avoiding 'why' questions."",

QUESTIONING SKILLS - SUMMARIZING,5,"The physician does a good job of summarizing the data obtained during the interview at various points, ensuring clarity and understanding. For example, the physician confirms the patient's history with mercury fillings: 'And it's been about 10 days, but you had some mercury fillings, some probably amalgam, are they silver-colored?' and 'And you had those removed about two years ago, is that correct?' This helps verify the timeline and details of the patient's dental history. Additionally, the physician summarizes the patient's health concerns related to chemical sensitivities: 'So you think it's just some chemical sensitivities to your teeth, and that's why you had the amalgam fillings removed then. Is that correct?' This ensures that the physician accurately understands the patient's concerns and reasons for previous dental work. The physician also confirms the patient's current symptoms and medical history: 'So we have shortness of breath. We're going to try to start out with go ahead and using the oxygen while you're comfortable. You have had some chest pain that kind of comes and goes.' This helps to ensure that all relevant symptoms are noted and addressed. Overall, the physician consistently summarizes the data obtained, verifying and clarifying information with the patient."
QUESTIONING SKILLS - DUPLICATION,5,No questions were duplicated.
QUESTIONING SKILLS - LACK OF JARGON,5,"The physician in this conversation does an excellent job of using language that is easily understood by the patient and avoids medical jargon. For example, when discussing the patient's fillings, the physician says, 'And it's been about 10 days, but you had some mercury fillings, some probably amalgam, are they silver-colored?' This avoids the use of technical terms without explanation. Additionally, the physician explains the safety of amalgam fillings by saying, 'the American Dental Association has said that amalgam fillings that have the mercury in it are safe to use,' which is clear and straightforward. The physician also reassures the patient by saying, 'we won't put anything in your mouth that you're not comfortable with first,' which is a clear and empathetic statement. Overall, the physician's language is accessible and patient-friendly throughout the conversation."
QUESTIONING SKILLS - VERIFICATION OF PATIENT INFORMATION (in vignette),N/A,"{
  ""explanation"": ""The physician in this conversation demonstrates a consistent effort to seek clarification, verification, and specificity of the patient's responses. For example, the physician asks, 'Can you describe the pain to me a little bit?' and follows up with, 'How long is the pain, like the duration of the pain?' This shows an effort to understand both the nature and the duration of the pain. The physician also asks about the patient's dental history, 'Have you had any problems with it before this or it's just started at 10 days, 10 days ago?' and 'Did you see the dentist regularly or just when it was painful for you?' These questions help to clarify the timeline and frequency of dental issues. 

Further, the physician inquires about the patient's use of a prescribed item, 'And you have to use it all the time or just outside of the house?' and 'And did a doctor prescribe that for you?' This ensures that the physician understands the context and necessity of the prescribed item. The physician also checks for any other significant medical problems, 'Any other significant medical problems besides the shortness of breath?' and 'Okay, but nothing has been diagnosed?' This helps to verify the patient's overall health status.

The physician also asks about family medical history, 'Any other medical problems that run in the family, heart problems or lung problems or anything like that?' and 'Do you live with your mom, or does she live close by?' These questions help to understand the patient's support system and potential genetic predispositions.

Finally, the physician asks about medications and allergies, 'Are you taking any medications at all?' and 'Besides the anesthetics and the latex, any other allergies at all that you know of?' This ensures a comprehensive understanding of the patient's current medical regimen and potential risks.

Overall, the physician's consistent efforts to clarify, verify, and specify patient responses demonstrate a high level of accuracy in understanding the patient's condition."",

VERBAL FACILITATION SKILLS,5,"The interviewer demonstrates consistent use of verbal encouragement and facilitation skills throughout the conversation. The physician frequently uses short statements and echoing to draw out more information from the patient. For example, when the patient mentions the pain, the physician responds with, 'It's very painful. On both sides?' and 'It's throbbing pain.' This shows active listening and encourages the patient to provide more details. Additionally, the physician acknowledges the patient's concerns and validates their experiences, such as when discussing the chemical sensitivities: 'No, I totally understand. We'll make sure that everything we do that you're comfortable with at first.' The physician also uses intermittent verbal encouragement, like 'Okay,' 'All right,' and 'Does that sound good?' to keep the conversation flowing and make the patient feel heard and supported."
EMPATHY AND ACKNOWLEDGING PATIENT CUES,5,"The physician demonstrates empathy and support throughout the conversation. The physician acknowledges the patient's stress and challenges by saying, 'It sounds like you've been under a lot of stress from these symptoms. It must be quite challenging for you.' This shows understanding and respect for the patient's feelings. The physician further supports the patient by stating, 'I can only imagine how tough that is. We're here to support you through this and find ways to make you feel better.' This reassures the patient that they are not alone and that the physician is committed to helping them. Additionally, the physician emphasizes the patient's comfort by saying, 'We'll make sure that everything we do that you're comfortable with at first. We're not going to do, you know, anything that you're not comfortable with.' This demonstrates respect for the patient's boundaries and a supportive approach."
PATIENT’S PERSPECTIVE (BELIEFS; Case specific),3,"The physician in this conversation does a good job of eliciting some of the patient's perspective on the illness, particularly regarding the patient's chemical sensitivities and the potential link to the new car and dental work. The physician asks questions like, 'Why did you have the fillings removed? What do you think was the problem?' and 'So you think the problems with your teeth, you think they're related to chemical sensitivities?' These questions help to understand the patient's beliefs and ideas about the cause of their symptoms. However, the physician does not fully explore the patient's feelings, the function of the illness in their life, or their expectations for treatment. The physician acknowledges the patient's concerns and offers to look into alternative materials for dental work, but there is limited follow-through on addressing the patient's broader beliefs and expectations. Therefore, the conversation scores a 3, as it elicits some of the patient's perspective but does not fully address all aspects of the FIFE framework."
IMPACT OF ILLNESS ON PATIENT AND PATIENT’S SELF-IMAGE,N/A,N/A
ACHIEVE A SHARED PLAN,5,"The physician in this conversation does discuss the diagnosis and plan with the patient. For example, the physician says, 'So what we'll probably do now is take a look, if that's okay, to see what we can find, kind of diagnose the problem a little bit.' This indicates that the physician is planning to diagnose the issue. Additionally, the physician mentions, 'And then we'll probably get a plan for you, kind of a treatment plan, that, you know, you will want to approve.' This shows that the physician is considering the patient's approval and preferences in the treatment plan. The physician also reassures the patient multiple times, saying, 'We'll make sure that everything we do that you're comfortable with at first,' and 'I'll have you look at the box first. I'll put them out here so you can see them.' These statements indicate that the physician is inviting the patient to contribute their thoughts, ideas, and preferences. Therefore, the conversation meets the criteria for a high score."
ENCOURAGEMENT OF QUESTIONS,1,Physician does not provide patient with opportunities for questions
SUPPORT SYSTEMS,3,"The physician begins by asking about the patient's living situation: 'Do you live with your mom, or does she live close by?' and confirms that the patient lives with their mother. The physician then inquires about family support: 'So do you have a little bit of family support then at home?' The patient explains that their mother is 78 and affected by diabetes, indicating that the support might be limited. The physician acknowledges this but does not delve deeper into the emotional or financial support aspects. The physician also asks about transportation: 'What about transportation? Is transportation going to be a problem or not?' and learns that the patient relies on friends for rides. However, the physician does not explore further into financial support or suggest any community resources that might help the patient and their mother. Therefore, while some aspects of support are touched upon, the exploration is not thorough."
PATIENT’S EDUCATION & UNDERSTANDING,2,"The physician does make an effort to educate the patient about the safety of amalgam fillings and mentions alternative materials: 'there are some other materials that we could use. There's some resins and certain other types of materials that we could try.' The physician also reassures the patient about their comfort: 'we won't put anything in your mouth that you're not comfortable with first.' However, the physician does not explicitly check for the patient's understanding or use the teach back technique. The physician does not ask the patient to repeat the information or confirm their understanding in any way. The closest the physician comes to checking understanding is asking if the plan sounds alright: 'Does that sound all right?' but this is not sufficient to ensure comprehension. Therefore, the physician provides information but does not check on understanding."
ASSESS MOTIVATION FOR CHANGES,N/A,N/A
CLOSURE,3,"The physician does specify some future plans, but not in a detailed manner. The physician mentions, 'We'll probably take a couple pictures of your teeth, x-rays. Is that all right, to take some x-rays of your teeth?' and 'I'll make sure we use some non-latex gloves so that won't be a problem.' This indicates what the physician will do next. However, there is no mention of what the patient should do next or when the next communication or appointment will be. The physician does say, 'I'll be back soon,' but this is vague and does not provide a clear timeline or next steps for the patient. Therefore, the plans for the future are only partially detailed."

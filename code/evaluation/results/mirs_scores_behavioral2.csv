OPENING,4,"The conversation includes a self-introduction ('I'm Cheyenne'), role clarification ('I'm a medical student'), and a polite inquiry about how to address the patient ('Now what would you like me to call you?'). However, the patient's name is not used in the inquiry. Therefore, it meets all the criteria except for using the patient's name in the address inquiry."
ELICITS SPECTRUM OF CONCERNS,3,"The physician begins by asking, 'So what brings you into the office today?' which is a good start to elicit the patient's main concern. The patient responds with a general desire to do something with exercise but is unsure about specifics. The physician acknowledges this and expresses willingness to discuss it further. However, the physician only asks, 'Is there anything else that you're concerned about?' once, and the patient responds with 'No.' The physician does not probe further to ensure there are no additional concerns. Therefore, the physician elicits the main concern but does not fully explore for any other potential issues the patient might have."
NEGOTIATES PRIORITIES & SETS AGENDA,1,Physician does not negotiate priorities or set an agenda.
ELICITING THE NARRATIVE THREAD or the ‘PATIENT’S STORY’,3,"The physician in this conversation generally allows the patient to talk about their problem and provides ample opportunities for the patient to share their story. For example, the physician starts with an open-ended question: 'So tell me why you want to start an exercise program.' This allows the patient to explain their situation in detail. The physician also listens to the patient's concerns about being tired and their interest in swimming and using machines. However, there are moments where the physician interrupts with focused questions, such as 'Do you have any ideas as to what it might be?' and 'Have you ever had any surgeries?' These interruptions, while relevant, slightly disrupt the narrative flow. Overall, the physician maintains a balance between letting the patient talk and guiding the conversation with pertinent questions."
TIMELINE,3,"The physician does make an effort to establish a timeline by asking about the duration of the patient's tiredness: 'And is this something you discussed with your doctor six months ago?' and 'is there anything that happened about a year ago that you can think of that would have made you tired for any reason?'. However, the physician does not delve deeply into the sequence of symptoms or events that might have contributed to the patient's condition. The patient mentions that the tiredness has been 'gradually getting more and more tired as the year went on,' but the physician does not follow up with more detailed questions to establish a complete chronology. Therefore, while some information is obtained, it is not sufficient to establish a clear and detailed timeline."
ORGANIZATION,N/A,"{
  ""explanation"": ""The physician's organization of the interview is quite logical and follows a clear structure. The conversation begins with gathering basic information about the patient's age and medical history, including current medications and recent doctor visits. For example, the physician asks, 'So how old are you, Velma?' and 'Do you take anything for it?' This establishes a foundation for understanding the patient's health status.

The physician then transitions smoothly into understanding the patient's reasons for wanting to start an exercise program: 'So tell me why you want to start an exercise program.' This is followed by exploring the patient's exercise history and preferences: 'Have you thought at all about types of exercise that you might be interested in?'

The physician also considers potential barriers to exercise, such as the patient's concerns about going to a gym due to varicose veins: 'Is there anything that you think would stop you from exercising?'

The conversation then moves to discussing the patient's family and social support, which is relevant for understanding potential exercise partners: 'Tell me something about your family. Who do you live with?'

Finally, the physician outlines a clear plan for starting the exercise program, including involving family members and considering financial and logistical aspects: 'How about we think about your starting a gym program and talking to your daughter, Lucy, and trying to get her involved in that with you.'

Overall, the questions follow a logical order, and the physician effectively uses the time to cover all necessary topics, ensuring that tasks are completed within the allotted time."",

PACING OF INTERVIEW,N/A,"{
  ""explanation"": ""The interviewer, Cheyenne, demonstrates a high level of attentiveness throughout the conversation. She listens carefully to Mrs. McCullough's responses and allows her to fully express her thoughts without interruption. For example, when Mrs. McCullough talks about her surgeries, Cheyenne listens and then follows up with relevant questions: 'Could you tell me about those?' and 'And is everything okay as a result of those surgeries?' This shows that she is paying close attention and is interested in the details of Mrs. McCullough's medical history. 

The interview progresses smoothly without any noticeable awkward pauses. Cheyenne uses silence effectively, giving Mrs. McCullough time to think and respond. For instance, after asking about the patient's exercise history, she waits for Mrs. McCullough to elaborate on her past activities: 'Yeah. Before the children were born, I used to play tennis a lot and did it, well, probably four or five days a week.' Cheyenne then acknowledges this information and continues the conversation seamlessly.

Overall, the pacing of the interview is comfortable and deliberate, with Cheyenne maintaining a steady flow of questions and responses. There are no interruptions or awkward pauses that disrupt the conversation, indicating a well-conducted interview."",

QUESTIONING SKILLS – TYPES OF QUESTIONS,N/A,"{
  ""explanation"": ""The physician begins the conversation with an open-ended question: 'How are you?' and follows up with another open-ended question: 'So what brings you into the office today?' This sets a good precedent for information gathering. The physician continues to use open-ended questions effectively, such as 'Is there anything else that you're concerned about?' and 'Tell me about your exercise history. Have you ever exercised routinely?' These questions allow the patient to provide detailed responses. 

However, there are instances where the physician uses more specific or direct questions without first using an open-ended question to explore a new topic. For example, 'Do you have any medical problems, anything that you know of?' and 'Do you take anything for it?' are direct questions that could have been preceded by a more open-ended inquiry about the patient's health history. Additionally, the physician asks multiple questions in a single turn, such as 'Is there anything that happened about a year ago that you can think of that would have made you tired for any reason?' and 'Do you have any ideas as to what it might be?' which can be overwhelming for the patient to answer comprehensively.

Overall, while the physician does use open-ended questions effectively in many parts of the conversation, there are several instances where the approach could be improved by starting with broader questions before narrowing down to specifics. This mixed approach results in an average score.

QUESTIONING SKILLS - SUMMARIZING,1,"The physician does not provide a clear summary of the data obtained during the interview. While the physician discusses various aspects of the patient's exercise plan and provides detailed instructions, there is no point where the physician explicitly summarizes the patient's medical history or the main points of the conversation. For example, the physician says, 'So just to make sure that I explained that clearly, I know I was a little jumbled in what I was saying, could you tell me what we just agreed upon and what you got from that?' This is more of a request for the patient to summarize rather than the physician summarizing the data obtained. Therefore, the physician fails to summarize any of the data obtained during the interview."
QUESTIONING SKILLS - DUPLICATION,5,No questions were duplicated.
QUESTIONING SKILLS - LACK OF JARGON,5,"The physician in this conversation consistently uses language that is easily understood by the patient and avoids medical jargon. For example, when discussing the patient's back pain, the physician says, 'I'd really like to make sure that any exercises you do on your back would be okay with your back pain with that prior surgery,' instead of using more technical terms related to the back surgery or specific medical conditions. Additionally, the physician explains the benefits of exercise in simple terms: 'Well, exercise is very good for your heart health, for your lung health, pretty much total body health.' The physician also ensures understanding by asking the patient to repeat back the plan: 'So just to make sure that I explained that clearly, I know I was a little jumbled in what I was saying, could you tell me what we just agreed upon and what you got from that?' This approach confirms that the patient comprehends the information without needing to ask for clarification. Overall, the physician's communication is clear and accessible."
QUESTIONING SKILLS - VERIFICATION OF PATIENT INFORMATION (in vignette),N/A,"{
  ""explanation"": ""The physician in this conversation demonstrates a consistent effort to clarify, verify, and specify the patient's responses, ensuring accurate understanding. For example, the physician asks, 'What type of neighborhood do you live in?' and follows up with, 'That's good. That means we could have you get out and walk a little bit.' This shows an effort to understand the patient's living environment and its implications for exercise. Additionally, the physician verifies the patient's family medical history by asking, 'And what did he die from?' and 'Does she have any other medical conditions?' The physician also seeks specificity regarding the patient's exercise preferences and potential companions, asking, 'Do you think you'd like to exercise with someone, or do you see yourself exercising by yourself?' and 'Is there anyone else who lives nearby that you think would be willing to exercise with you?' Finally, the physician ensures the patient understands the plan by asking, 'So just to make sure that I explained that clearly, I know I was a little jumbled in what I was saying, could you tell me what we just agreed upon and what you got from that?' This consistent approach to seeking clarification, verification, and specificity warrants a high score."",

VERBAL FACILITATION SKILLS,5,"The physician in this conversation demonstrates a consistent use of verbal encouragement and facilitation skills to engage the patient. The physician uses short statements and echoing effectively, such as when they say, 'That sounds good,' 'Good,' and 'That's good,' which helps to affirm the patient's responses and encourage further dialogue. The physician also draws out information by asking questions like, 'So you said you live in a condo. And what town?' and 'Would you like to start exercising as of a few days from now?' Additionally, the physician provides intermittent verbal encouragement, such as, 'It's always good to look back and see that you've done it,' and 'Sure. Good. That sounds good.' These statements help to praise the patient for their efforts and encourage them to continue with their health care routine. Overall, the physician's consistent use of facilitative skills and verbal encouragement throughout the conversation warrants a high score."
EMPATHY AND ACKNOWLEDGING PATIENT CUES,5,"The physician in this conversation demonstrates a good level of empathy and support throughout the interaction. For example, the physician acknowledges the patient's concerns about back pain and the impact of prior surgery by saying, 'And we might do it here at the doctor's office, or I might have you speak with a physical therapist. I'd really like to make sure that any exercises you do on your back would be okay with your back pain with that prior surgery.' This shows understanding and respect for the patient's condition. Additionally, the physician offers support by suggesting a follow-up appointment to assess the patient's back before starting an exercise program: 'And then what we can do is we can get you back in here or to see the physical therapist within that week.' The physician also encourages the patient by discussing the benefits of exercise and involving family members, which shows a supportive approach: 'How about we think about your starting a gym program and talking to your daughter, Lucy, and trying to get her involved in that with you.' Overall, the physician uses supportive comments and demonstrates empathy effectively."
PATIENT’S PERSPECTIVE (BELIEFS; Case specific),3,"The physician does make an effort to understand the patient's perspective on their fatigue. For example, the physician asks, 'Is there anything that happened about a year ago that you can think of that would have made you tired for any reason?' and 'Do you have any ideas as to what it might be?' These questions aim to elicit the patient's thoughts and feelings about the cause of their symptoms. However, the physician does not delve deeply into the patient's beliefs, feelings, ideas of cause, function, and expectations (FIFE). The conversation is somewhat superficial and does not fully explore the patient's perspective or provide ample opportunities for the patient to ask questions or bring up additional topics. Therefore, while the physician does make some effort, it is not comprehensive."
IMPACT OF ILLNESS ON PATIENT AND PATIENT’S SELF-IMAGE,3,"The physician acknowledges the patient's concern about their varicose veins and the impact it has on their willingness to exercise, particularly in a gym setting. The physician says, 'We'll keep that in mind, too, when we eventually talk about what exactly we should be doing.' This shows some recognition of the patient's self-image issues related to their condition. However, the physician does not delve deeper into how the varicose veins affect the patient's life or self-image beyond the immediate concern about exercising. Additionally, no counseling or resources are offered to help the patient cope with these feelings. Therefore, the physician partially addresses the impact of the illness on the patient's life but does not fully explore it or offer additional support."
ACHIEVE A SHARED PLAN,5,"The physician in this conversation thoroughly discusses the patient's concerns about starting an exercise program and explores the potential reasons behind the patient's fatigue. The physician also considers the patient's medical history, including high cholesterol and past surgeries, and how these might impact the choice of exercise. The physician negotiates a plan with the patient, suggesting a gym program and involving family members for support. The physician also addresses the patient's concerns about varicose veins and back pain, suggesting a follow-up with a physical therapist. Throughout the conversation, the physician invites the patient to contribute their thoughts and preferences, such as when discussing the types of exercise the patient might enjoy and the involvement of family members. For example, the physician says, 'How about we think about your starting a gym program and talking to your daughter, Lucy, and trying to get her involved in that with you.' The physician also ensures the patient understands the plan by asking them to repeat it back, 'So just to make sure that I explained that clearly, I know I was a little jumbled in what I was saying, could you tell me what we just agreed upon and what you got from that?' This approach aligns with a high-quality interaction where the patient is actively involved in the decision-making process."
ENCOURAGEMENT OF QUESTIONS,1,Physician does not provide patient with opportunities for questions
SUPPORT SYSTEMS,4,"The interviewer explores several aspects of the patient's support system. They ask about family members in the area, learning that the patient has a daughter in Manchester and a son in Westwood, New Jersey. This addresses the emotional support aspect. The interviewer also inquires about the patient's work status and financial concerns, to which the patient responds that they work part-time and are living comfortably, even considering retirement. This addresses the financial support aspect. Lastly, the interviewer asks about insurance, and the patient confirms they have insurance through their husband's work, addressing access to healthcare. However, the interviewer does not suggest any additional community resources or delve deeper into the emotional support aspect beyond knowing the locations of the patient's children."
PATIENT’S EDUCATION & UNDERSTANDING,3,"The physician does a good job of providing appropriate education about the benefits of exercise, stating that it is 'very good for your heart health, for your lung health, pretty much total body health.' The physician also connects exercise to potential weight loss and its benefits, which is relevant and informative. However, the physician does not use the teach back technique to ensure the patient's understanding. The physician asks, 'Does that make sense?' which is a basic check for understanding but does not go further to confirm the patient's comprehension or interest in a more thorough manner. The patient responds with 'Yeah, it does,' but this does not provide a clear indication of their understanding or interest level. Therefore, the physician's approach aligns with a score of 3, as there is an attempt to check understanding but no use of the teach back technique."
ASSESS MOTIVATION FOR CHANGES,5,"The physician inquires about the patient's feelings and motivations for starting an exercise program multiple times throughout the conversation. For example, the physician asks, 'So tell me why you want to start an exercise program,' which allows the patient to express their concerns about feeling tired. The physician also explores the patient's readiness and potential barriers, such as when they discuss the patient's discomfort with going to a gym due to varicose veins: 'Do you think you'd be less worried about those if your daughter were with you?' The physician provides tailored options and support, suggesting a gym with a personal trainer and discussing the possibility of involving family members: 'How about we think about your starting a gym program and talking to your daughter, Lucy, and trying to get her involved in that with you.' The physician also plans follow-up appointments to reassess and support the patient's progress: 'I'll give you a calendar, and on that calendar you could write down which exercises you do each day.' Overall, the physician effectively assesses the patient's motivation and provides appropriate support and options."
CLOSURE,5,"The physician clearly specifies the future plans for both themselves and the patient. The physician states, 'I'll let you talk to your family members and we'll set you up for an appointment within the next week,' which outlines the immediate next steps for the patient. Additionally, the physician mentions, 'I'll let you start on the exercise program in about a week,' and 'I'll make a follow-up appointment with you for a month from now to talk about how it's going,' providing a clear timeline for the patient's activities and the next communication. The physician also concludes with, 'I'm going to go get the doctor and you can sit here for a few minutes and we'll be back in to discuss,' which specifies the immediate next action. These details ensure that the patient knows what to expect and when."

OPENING,5,"The physician provides a complete self-introduction by stating, 'Hi, I'm Brianna.' She also clarifies her role by saying, 'I'm a medical student.' Finally, she makes a polite inquiry about how to address the patient by asking, 'Is that how you'd like to be addressed today?' This covers all the necessary elements: self-introduction, role clarification, and a polite inquiry about the patient's preferred form of address."
ELICITS SPECTRUM OF CONCERNS,3,"In the provided conversation, the physician begins by asking the patient what brought them to the office, which is a good start. The patient responds with a concern about chest pain and a worry that it might be related to their heart. The physician then expresses empathy but does not follow up with additional questions to probe for any other concerns the patient might have. The conversation ends without the physician asking if there are any other issues or concerns. Therefore, the physician only elicits the patient's main concern without probing for additional concerns."
NEGOTIATES PRIORITIES & SETS AGENDA,1,Physician does not negotiate priorities or set an agenda.
ELICITING THE NARRATIVE THREAD or the ‘PATIENT’S STORY’,2,"The physician starts the conversation by asking the patient to talk about their problem: 'All right, so tell me a little bit about what brought you to the office today.' This is a good opening, but the physician frequently interrupts the patient with specific questions, such as 'Oh, okay. And what makes it sharp?' and 'Okay, and is there anything that makes the pain better?' This pattern continues throughout the conversation, with the physician often steering the discussion with focused questions rather than allowing the patient to provide a complete narrative. For example, 'Okay, and you said lifting makes it worse.' and 'Okay, do you lift on a regular basis or did you notice it somehow?' These interruptions create a Q&A style rather than a conversational flow. While the physician does gather detailed information, the frequent interruptions prevent the patient from sharing their story in a more natural and uninterrupted manner."
TIMELINE,5,"The physician does a thorough job of establishing a timeline and history of the present illness. The physician asks when the pain started: 'It's been going on for how long now?' to which the patient responds, 'It started about two nights ago.' The physician also inquires about the progression of the pain: 'Is it getting better or worse over time?' and the patient replies, 'It's about the same.' Additionally, the physician summarizes the timeline and symptoms at the end of the conversation: 'So it sounds like you've had chest pain for two days now. Sometimes it's an ache, sometimes it's sharp.' This summary helps to confirm the chronology and details of the patient's symptoms."
ORGANIZATION,5,"The physician's interview is well-organized and follows a logical order, ensuring that all relevant topics are covered systematically. The conversation starts with the physician asking about the patient's current issue: 'All right, so tell me a little bit about what brought you to the office today.' This is followed by detailed questions about the nature of the pain, its triggers, and what alleviates it: 'Oh, okay. And what makes it sharp?' and 'Okay, and is there anything that makes the pain better?' The physician then moves on to the patient's medical history, medications, and family history in a structured manner: 'In terms of your past medical history, do you have any ongoing medical problems?' and 'Can you tell me a little bit about that?' The social history is also covered logically, including questions about living situation, recreational activities, and substance use: 'Can you tell me about your living situation?' and 'Do you drink any alcohol?' The physician effectively summarizes the information gathered at various points, ensuring clarity: 'So just to summarize your past medical history, it sounds like you're pretty healthy.' Overall, the interview is comprehensive and well-structured, making effective use of time."
PACING OF INTERVIEW,5,"The interviewer in this conversation demonstrates a high level of attentiveness and allows the patient to fully express their concerns without interruption. For example, the interviewer asks open-ended questions such as, 'Can you tell me a little bit about that?' and 'Do you think that you could look to your girlfriend in a time of need for her to help you out if you were sick or anything like that?' These questions encourage the patient to provide detailed responses. The interviewer also uses summarization effectively, saying, 'So it sounds like there's a possibility that your chest pain could be related to the mountain biking incident,' which shows they are actively listening and processing the information provided by the patient. There are no awkward pauses or interruptions, and the conversation flows smoothly. Silence is used deliberately, allowing the patient to continue speaking without feeling rushed."
QUESTIONING SKILLS – TYPES OF QUESTIONS,5,"The physician begins the conversation with an open-ended question: 'All right, so tell me a little bit about what brought you to the office today?' This is a good start as it allows the patient to provide a broad overview of their concerns. The physician follows up with another open-ended question: 'Can you tell me a little bit about that?' which continues to encourage the patient to elaborate. However, the physician then shifts to more specific questions such as 'And what makes it sharp?' and 'Is there anything that makes the pain better?' These are appropriate follow-up questions to gather more detailed information. The physician continues with specific questions like 'How much Advil are you taking?' and 'Do you know what the dose is of the Advil?' which are necessary to understand the patient's medication usage. The physician also asks about other symptoms and lifestyle factors, such as 'Do you have any other symptoms besides the pain in your chest?' and 'Do you lift on a regular basis or did you notice it somehow?' These questions are specific but relevant to the patient's condition. The physician does not use any leading, why, or multiple questions, which maintains the quality of information gathered. Overall, the physician effectively balances open-ended and specific questions, starting each major line of inquiry with an open-ended question and following up with more specific ones as needed."
QUESTIONING SKILLS - SUMMARIZING,5,"The physician consistently summarizes the data obtained during the interview at the end of each major line of inquiry. For example, after discussing the patient's current symptoms, the physician states, 'So I'd just like to summarize a little bit. So it sounds like you've had chest pain for two days now... Does that sound about right?' This ensures that the information is accurate and complete. Similarly, the physician summarizes the patient's past medical history: 'So just to summarize your past medical history, it sounds like you're pretty healthy. You just have seasonal allergies in the fall. And you said you take Flonase for that?' The physician also summarizes the patient's social history: 'So in terms of your social history, we talked about your work. You lift boxes.' These summaries help verify and clarify the information obtained, demonstrating a thorough and methodical approach."
QUESTIONING SKILLS - DUPLICATION,5,No questions were duplicated.
QUESTIONING SKILLS - LACK OF JARGON,5,"The physician in this conversation consistently uses language that is easily understood by the patient and avoids medical jargon. For example, the physician asks, 'Can you tell me a little bit about that?' and 'Is there anything that makes the pain better?' These questions are straightforward and do not include any complex medical terms. Additionally, when summarizing the patient's symptoms, the physician says, 'So it sounds like you've had chest pain for two days now. Sometimes it's an ache, sometimes it's sharp.' This summary is clear and uses simple language. The physician also avoids using medical jargon when discussing the patient's past medical history and social history, asking questions like, 'Do you take any medicines on a daily basis?' and 'Can you tell me about your living situation?' Overall, the physician's communication is clear and accessible, making it easy for the patient to understand."
QUESTIONING SKILLS - VERIFICATION OF PATIENT INFORMATION (in vignette),5,"The physician consistently seeks to clarify, verify, and specify the patient's responses throughout the conversation. For example, the physician asks, 'Can you tell me a little bit about that?' to get more details about the pain. When the patient mentions taking Advil, the physician follows up with, 'Okay, do you know what the dose is of the Advil?' to ensure accurate understanding of the medication usage. The physician also verifies the timeline of the pain by asking, 'Okay, so you mentioned a couple days. It's been going on for how long now?' and 'Two nights ago. Okay, and is it getting better or worse over time?' Additionally, the physician clarifies the patient's social history and activities, such as asking, 'Okay. And do you have any family or friends in the area?' and 'You like to mountain bike. Okay. Have you been mountain biking recently?' This consistent approach to seeking clarification, verification, and specificity ensures a comprehensive understanding of the patient's condition."
VERBAL FACILITATION SKILLS,5,"The physician in this conversation demonstrates a consistent use of verbal encouragement and facilitation skills to engage the patient. The physician frequently uses short statements and echoing to draw out more information from the patient. For example, the physician says, 'Okay, so tell me a little bit about what brought you to the office today,' which encourages the patient to share more details. The physician also summarizes the patient's information to ensure understanding, such as, 'So it sounds like you've had chest pain for two days now... Does that sound about right?' This shows active listening and helps the patient feel heard. Additionally, the physician uses follow-up questions to delve deeper into the patient's history and symptoms, like, 'Okay, and you lift boxes at work?' and 'Okay, like any coughing, any shortness of breath?' These techniques are used regularly and appropriately throughout the conversation, making the patient feel engaged and supported."
EMPATHY AND ACKNOWLEDGING PATIENT CUES,3,"The physician's responses in the conversation excerpt show a basic level of empathy but lack depth and specific techniques for demonstrating empathy. The physician acknowledges the patient's situation with statements like 'I'm really sorry to hear about that' and 'Well, that's understandable.' However, these comments are quite generic and do not delve into the patient's emotions or experiences in a meaningful way. The physician does not use the NURS technique (name, understand, respect, support) or any other specific methods to show deeper empathy. Therefore, while the physician is not negative or critical, the level of empathy demonstrated is neutral."
PATIENT’S PERSPECTIVE (BELIEFS; Case specific),1,"The physician in this conversation does not actively elicit the patient's perspective on the illness, including their beliefs, feelings, ideas of cause, function, and expectations (FIFE). The physician asks about the duration and nature of the symptoms, and whether the patient will be able to take time off work, but does not delve into the patient's own thoughts or concerns about the cause of the symptoms or their expectations for treatment. For example, the physician does not ask questions like 'What do you think might be causing your chest pain?' or 'How do you feel about your symptoms?' The conversation is more focused on gathering factual information rather than understanding the patient's perspective. Therefore, the score is low."
IMPACT OF ILLNESS ON PATIENT AND PATIENT’S SELF-IMAGE,3,"The physician does inquire about the impact of the illness on the patient's life, particularly focusing on the patient's work and support system. For example, the physician asks, 'Okay, and do you think your boss would be okay with you taking some time off if you needed to?' and 'So do you think that you could look to your girlfriend in a time of need for her to help you out if you were sick or anything like that?' These questions show an attempt to understand how the illness affects the patient's daily life and support network. However, the physician does not delve deeply into the patient's feelings about the illness or offer any counseling or resources to help cope with the situation. Therefore, the exploration is partial but not comprehensive."
ACHIEVE A SHARED PLAN,1,"In the provided conversation, the physician acknowledges the possibility that the patient's chest pain could be related to a mountain biking incident. However, the physician does not discuss a specific diagnosis or prognosis, nor do they negotiate a plan with the patient. The physician simply states, 'I will talk with my doctor and you can wait here. I'll be back in a few minutes.' There is no invitation for the patient to contribute their thoughts, ideas, suggestions, or preferences. Therefore, the conversation lacks the elements required for a higher score."
ENCOURAGEMENT OF QUESTIONS,1,Physician does not provide patient with opportunities for questions.
SUPPORT SYSTEMS,3,"The physician inquires about the patient's living situation and support system, asking about family, friends, and a significant other. The physician asks, 'Can you tell me about your living situation?' and 'And do you have any family or friends in the area?' The patient responds that their family lives 45 minutes away and that their girlfriend lives in town. The physician further explores the support from the girlfriend by asking, 'So do you think that you could look to your girlfriend in a time of need for her to help you out if you were sick or anything like that?' The patient confirms that the girlfriend has been supportive. However, the physician does not inquire about financial support, access to healthcare, or suggest any community resources. Therefore, while some aspects of the support system are explored, it is not comprehensive."
PATIENT’S EDUCATION & UNDERSTANDING,N/A,N/A
ASSESS MOTIVATION FOR CHANGES,N/A,N/A
CLOSURE,3,"The physician does specify some future plans, but the details are minimal. The physician states, 'I will talk with my doctor and you can wait here. I'll be back in a few minutes.' This indicates what the physician will do (talk with their doctor) and what the patient should do (wait here). However, there is no mention of any further steps beyond this immediate action, such as follow-up appointments or additional instructions for the patient. Therefore, the plan is only partially detailed."

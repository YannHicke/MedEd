OPENING,3,"The physician provides a self-introduction by stating, 'My name is Tom.' However, there is no role clarification provided, and there is no polite inquiry about how to address the patient by name. The physician does address the patient by name, 'Ms. Park,' and asks how she is doing, but this does not fulfill the requirement for a polite inquiry about how to address the patient."
ELICITS SPECTRUM OF CONCERNS,3,"The interviewer begins by asking the patient what brings them into the clinic, which is a good start to elicit the patient's main concern: 'I have like bleeding in my gum, so I just wonder what happened.' The interviewer then asks about pain associated with the bleeding, 'Are you feeling any pain with that bleeding?' and follows up with a question about when the bleeding occurs, 'Is that the only time that it happens when you're brushing your teeth or you're flossing?' However, the interviewer does not ask if there are any other concerns or symptoms the patient might be experiencing. The conversation focuses solely on the main concern without probing for additional issues."
NEGOTIATES PRIORITIES & SETS AGENDA,1,Physician does not negotiate priorities or set an agenda.
ELICITING THE NARRATIVE THREAD or the ‘PATIENT’S STORY’,3,"The physician generally allows the patient to talk but occasionally interrupts with focused questions. For example, the physician asks, 'How long is this bleeding, gums? How long have they been going on?' and 'Are you taking any medications, whether prescription or herbal or alternative medications?' These questions are relevant but interrupt the patient's narrative. Additionally, the physician introduces unrelated topics, such as cultural practices, which, while important, shift the focus away from the patient's immediate concern about gum bleeding. Overall, the conversation maintains a Q&A style rather than a complete narrative thread."
TIMELINE,5,"The physician does a thorough job of establishing a timeline and history of the present illness. The physician asks the patient when the bleeding started: 'How long is this bleeding, gums? How long have they been going on?' The patient responds, 'I think about a couple of weeks.' The physician also inquires about the frequency and context of the symptoms: 'Is that the only time that it happens when you're brushing your teeth or you're flossing?' and 'During the day, sometimes sore, but mainly when I brush my teeth, sore and bleeding.' Additionally, the physician connects the symptoms to the patient's pregnancy: 'Sometimes there's a correlation during your second trimester, which you're just starting, between gingivitis and pregnancy.' This establishes a clear chronology of the chief concern and history of the present illness, including the sequence of associated symptoms and events."
ORGANIZATION,5,"The physician's organization of the interview is quite logical and follows a clear sequence. The conversation begins with a general greeting and inquiry about the patient's condition: 'How are you doing today?' followed by 'What brings you into the dental clinic today?' This sets the stage for understanding the patient's primary concern. The physician then delves into specifics about the symptoms: 'Are you feeling any pain with that bleeding?' and 'Is that the only time that it happens when you're brushing your teeth or you're flossing?' The physician also takes into account the patient's pregnancy, which is relevant to the symptoms: 'Now it says in your chart here that you're pregnant?' and 'How far along are you?' The physician explains the potential link between pregnancy and gingivitis in a clear and structured manner: 'Sometimes there's a correlation during your second trimester, which you're just starting, between gingivitis and pregnancy.' The conversation then moves to discussing the patient's oral hygiene habits and the importance of maintaining them: 'How often are you generally brushing and flossing?' The physician also addresses the patient's cultural practices and concerns about medication: 'You take the vitamin only?' and 'Are you doing anything else to alleviate the gum problems?' Finally, the physician outlines the treatment plan and addresses the patient's concerns about anesthesia: 'We can do it as it currently is without medication.' and 'When we give you the anesthesia, we will keep it just in the area of your mouth that we're working on.' Overall, the questions follow a logical order, and the physician effectively uses the time to cover all necessary topics."
PACING OF INTERVIEW,5,"The interviewer demonstrates a high level of attentiveness throughout the conversation. The physician listens to the patient's responses without interruption and provides detailed explanations when needed. For example, when the patient asks for a slower explanation about the correlation between pregnancy and gingivitis, the physician responds, 'Sure. No problem. When you're pregnant, your body is producing hormones such as estrogen and progesterone in high levels.' The interview progresses smoothly without any awkward pauses, and the physician uses silence deliberately to allow the patient to process information and respond. The conversation flows naturally, and the physician ensures that the patient understands the information by asking, 'So do you understand everything that I'm telling you about? Could you just tell me what you think that I'm telling you, just so we're both on the same page?' This indicates a deliberate and thoughtful pacing of the interview."
QUESTIONING SKILLS – TYPES OF QUESTIONS,N/A,"{
  ""explanation"": ""The physician begins the conversation with an open-ended question: 'How are you doing today?' This is a good start. However, the next question, 'What brings you into the dental clinic today?' is also open-ended and appropriate for gathering initial information. The physician then asks, 'Are you feeling any pain with that bleeding?' which is a specific question but follows logically from the patient's likely response about their reason for visiting. The sequence continues with a mix of specific and open-ended questions, such as 'Is that the only time that it happens when you're brushing your teeth or you're flossing?' and 'How far along are you?' These questions are appropriate and help to gather detailed information. 

The physician continues with specific questions like 'How long is this bleeding, gums? How long have they been going on?' and 'How often are you generally brushing and flossing?' These are necessary to understand the patient's dental hygiene habits. The question 'Are you flossing?' is specific but follows logically from the previous question. 

The physician then asks, 'Are you doing anything else to alleviate the gum problems, the soreness that you're having from that? Are you putting any medications in your mouth?' which is a multiple question and could be broken down for clarity. 

The physician also asks about concerns with treatment and sitting in the dental chair, which are specific but relevant: 'Do you have any other concerns or problems with the treatment that we're going to be giving?' and 'Do you have any concerns about sitting in the dental chair for a long period of time?' 

The question 'Do you have any concerns about stressing the baby while you're in the chair? Do you have any anxiety when you're sitting in the dental chair or trouble sitting through a procedure?' is another multiple question that could be simplified. 

The physician checks for understanding with 'Do you understand everything that I'm telling you about? Could you just tell me what you think that I'm telling you, just so we're both on the same page?' which is good practice. 

The question about consulting for health decisions is specific but relevant: 'Generally, who do you consult with for your health decisions? Do you have someone, like, are you married? Do you have any family members other than your husband? I see that you're wearing a wedding ring. Do you have any family members other than your husband that you would consult for your health care decisions?' 

The physician asks about smoking, drinking, and drug use with specific questions: 'Now, I just want to ask you, in the past have you or do you currently smoke or drink any alcoholic beverages?' and 'You haven't used any illicit drugs such as marijuana or cocaine?' 

Finally, the physician asks if the patient has any other questions: 'Do you have any other questions for me today?' and 'Do you have any other questions for me?' which are open-ended and appropriate for concluding the conversation.

Overall, the physician uses a mix of open-ended and specific questions, with a few instances of multiple questions. The sequence is logical and appropriate for gathering detailed information.

QUESTIONING SKILLS - SUMMARIZING,1,"The physician does not provide a clear summary of the data obtained during the interview. While the physician offers detailed explanations and recommendations, there is no point where the physician explicitly summarizes the patient's condition or the information gathered. For example, the physician discusses the relationship between gingivitis and pregnancy, the importance of oral hygiene, and the treatment plan, but does not summarize the patient's specific symptoms or history. The closest the physician comes to summarizing is when they outline the treatment plan: 'So I'm just going to tell you what our overall plan is. What we're going to do is we'll, I think we have time now, we're going to do a complete periodontal exam on you.' However, this is more of a plan outline rather than a summary of the data obtained."
QUESTIONING SKILLS - DUPLICATION,5,No questions were duplicated.
QUESTIONING SKILLS - LACK OF JARGON,5,"The physician generally uses language that is easily understood by the patient and avoids medical jargon. For example, the physician explains the relationship between pregnancy hormones and gingivitis in simple terms: 'When you're pregnant, your body is producing hormones such as estrogen and progesterone in high levels.' The physician also explains the role of plaque and bacteria in causing gingivitis without using overly technical language: 'In that plaque, there's bacteria. Sometimes the body's response against the bacteria with the hormones can be inflammation and can cause gingivitis.' When the patient expresses concern about anesthesia, the physician reassures her with clear language: 'When we give you the anesthesia, we will keep it just in the area of your mouth that we're working on, and we'll try to give you as little as possible to make it effective.' The physician also uses the term 'quadrants' but immediately explains it in a way that is easy to understand: 'When we do deep cleanings, we generally divide your mouth into four quadrants. And generally, at each visit, we do one of the four quadrants.' Overall, the physician's communication is clear and avoids unnecessary medical jargon, making the conversation accessible to the patient."
QUESTIONING SKILLS - VERIFICATION OF PATIENT INFORMATION (in vignette),5,"The physician in this conversation consistently seeks to clarify, verify, and specify the patient's responses, ensuring accurate understanding. For example, the physician asks, 'How long is this bleeding, gums? How long have they been going on?' and follows up with 'A couple of weeks?' to confirm the duration. The physician also verifies the patient's medication use by asking, 'Are you taking any medications, whether prescription or herbal or alternative medications?' and clarifies further by asking about specific cultural practices, 'And this tea, is it commonly done in your culture, in your Korean, correct?' Additionally, the physician ensures understanding of the patient's beliefs and practices during pregnancy by asking, 'What is generally done during the pregnancy in terms of beliefs that are thought to be good for the baby, to keep the baby healthy?' The physician also seeks to confirm the patient's understanding of the treatment plan by asking, 'So do you understand everything that I'm telling you about? Could you just tell me what you think that I'm telling you, just so we're both on the same page?' This consistent approach to seeking clarification, verification, and specificity demonstrates a high level of communication."
VERBAL FACILITATION SKILLS,5,"The physician in this conversation demonstrates a consistent use of verbal encouragement and facilitation skills to engage the patient. The physician frequently uses short statements and echoing to draw out more information from the patient. For example, when the patient mentions bleeding gums, the physician asks, 'Are you feeling any pain with that bleeding?' and 'Is that the only time that it happens when you're brushing your teeth or you're flossing?' These questions encourage the patient to provide more details about her condition. Additionally, the physician provides explanations and reassurances, such as, 'When you eliminate that plaque by brushing and flossing and having dental cleanings during your pregnancy, there will be no gingivitis.' This helps the patient understand the importance of oral hygiene and encourages her to follow the recommended practices. The physician also acknowledges the patient's cultural beliefs and practices, asking, 'What is generally done during the pregnancy in terms of beliefs that are thought to be good for the baby, to keep the baby healthy?' This shows respect for the patient's background and encourages open communication. Overall, the physician's consistent use of facilitative skills and verbal encouragement throughout the conversation merits a high score."
EMPATHY AND ACKNOWLEDGING PATIENT CUES,5,"The physician demonstrates empathy and understanding in the conversation. In the first statement, 'I can completely understand that you don't want to put chemicals in your body with your belief system and whatnot during the pregnancy,' the physician acknowledges and respects the patient's beliefs and concerns. This shows an understanding of the patient's perspective. In the second statement, 'Absolutely. We can certainly take care of that for you,' the physician offers support and reassurance, indicating a willingness to accommodate the patient's preferences. These comments align with the NURS framework (name, understand, respect, support), demonstrating a high level of empathy."
PATIENT’S PERSPECTIVE (BELIEFS; Case specific),5,"The physician in this conversation does a commendable job of eliciting the patient's perspective on her illness and addressing her concerns. The physician asks about the patient's cultural practices and beliefs, such as, 'What is generally done during the pregnancy in terms of beliefs that are thought to be good for the baby, to keep the baby healthy?' This shows an effort to understand the patient's background and beliefs. The physician also addresses the patient's concerns about medication and anesthesia, 'I can completely understand that you don't want to put chemicals in your body with your belief system and whatnot during the pregnancy.' Furthermore, the physician provides reassurance and scientific evidence to alleviate the patient's concerns, 'Yes, we have a lot of scientific evidence that anesthetic is safe.' The physician also checks for understanding and encourages the patient to express any remaining concerns, 'Do you understand everything that I'm telling you about? Could you just tell me what you think that I'm telling you, just so we're both on the same page?' This approach ensures that the patient feels heard and involved in her treatment plan. Overall, the physician effectively elicits the patient's healing practices, beliefs, and expectations, and addresses them thoroughly."
IMPACT OF ILLNESS ON PATIENT AND PATIENT’S SELF-IMAGE,3,"The physician does not explicitly inquire about the patient's feelings regarding the gum disease or how it has impacted her life and self-image. The conversation primarily focuses on the medical aspects of the condition and the treatment options. The physician does address the patient's concerns about the safety of anesthesia during pregnancy and provides reassurance based on scientific evidence, but there is no exploration of the emotional or psychological impact of the illness. For example, the physician says, 'I can completely understand that you don't want to put chemicals in your body with your belief system and whatnot during the pregnancy,' but does not delve deeper into how the gum disease or the treatment process might be affecting the patient's daily life or self-perception. Therefore, the physician partially addresses the patient's concerns but does not fully explore the impact of the illness on her life or self-image."
ACHIEVE A SHARED PLAN,5,"The physician thoroughly discusses the diagnosis of gingivitis and its potential implications during pregnancy, including the risk of preterm birth and low birth weight. The physician explains the correlation between hormonal changes and gum disease, and emphasizes the importance of good oral hygiene and dental cleanings. The physician also outlines a detailed plan for treatment, including the need for a periodontal exam and potentially multiple visits for deep cleanings. The physician invites the patient to share concerns and preferences, such as anxiety about dental procedures and the use of anesthetics, and addresses these concerns by explaining the safety of anesthetics and offering to minimize their use. The physician also asks the patient to confirm their understanding and to share who they consult for healthcare decisions, indicating a collaborative approach. Quotes supporting this include: 'Do you have any other concerns or problems with the treatment that we're going to be giving?' and 'So do you understand everything that I'm telling you about? Could you just tell me what you think that I'm telling you, just so we're both on the same page?'"
ENCOURAGEMENT OF QUESTIONS,5,"The physician provides the patient with three opportunities to ask questions or bring up additional topics. The first opportunity is given with the question, 'Do you have any other concerns or problems with the treatment that we're going to be giving?' The second opportunity is provided with, 'So do you have any other questions for me today?' The third opportunity is given with, 'Do you have any other questions for me?' These opportunities are spread throughout the conversation, including one at the end, which aligns with the criteria for a high score."
SUPPORT SYSTEMS,3,"The physician begins by asking about the patient's support system, specifically inquiring if the patient is married and if there are any family members other than the husband involved in health decisions. The patient mentions living with her husband and parents-in-law and that she discussed her gum bleeding with her husband, who suggested visiting a dental clinic. However, the physician does not delve deeper into the emotional or financial support available to the patient, nor does the physician explore the patient's access to healthcare or suggest any community resources. The conversation lacks a thorough exploration of the patient's support systems beyond the initial inquiry about family members. Therefore, the physician only partially determines some aspects of the available support but does not fully explore or suggest resources."
PATIENT’S EDUCATION & UNDERSTANDING,5,"The physician effectively educates the patient about the correlation between pregnancy and gingivitis, explaining the role of hormones and the importance of oral hygiene. The physician also discusses the potential risks of untreated gingivitis, such as preterm birth and low birth weight. The physician checks the patient's understanding multiple times, asking questions like, 'Do you understand everything that I'm telling you about?' and 'Could you just tell me what you think that I'm telling you, just so we're both on the same page?' This use of the teach-back technique ensures the patient comprehends the information. The physician also addresses the patient's concerns about anesthesia and provides reassurance based on scientific evidence. Overall, the physician determines the patient's level of interest, provides appropriate education, and uses the teach-back technique effectively."
ASSESS MOTIVATION FOR CHANGES,1,"The physician does not inquire about the patient's feelings or motivation regarding the suggested changes to their oral hygiene routine. Instead, the physician directly provides instructions and the rationale behind them. For example, the physician says, 'Oh, if you can do it once in the morning and once at night, that's fine,' and 'you're going to want to do that once a day before you go to bed at least.' While the physician provides useful information and explains the importance of these changes, they do not assess the patient's readiness or motivation to implement these changes. Therefore, the physician fails to explore the patient's feelings or offer tailored support based on the patient's level of readiness."
CLOSURE,5,"The physician provides a clear and detailed plan for the future. The physician states, 'What we're going to do is we'll, I think we have time now, we're going to do a complete periodontal exam on you.' This specifies the immediate next step. The physician further explains, 'At that time, we'll be able to tell exactly how many visits you need to come in for,' and breaks down the potential number of visits: 'one visit for a general cleaning' and 'one visit for each quadrant that we decide you need a deep cleaning on.' The physician also clarifies the range of visits: 'That can be between anywhere from one to four visits,' and 'the most amount of visits that we're looking at is five. The least amount is one.' Finally, the physician concludes with, 'So we'll be able to tell you that at the end of today's visit,' providing a clear timeline for when the patient will receive more information. This level of detail ensures that the patient knows what to expect next and when they will receive further information."

OPENING,5,"The physician begins with a self-introduction: 'Hi. My name is Amy.' This covers the self-introduction part. The physician then clarifies her role by stating, 'I'm a second-year medical student.' This covers the role clarification part. Finally, the physician makes a polite inquiry about how to address the patient by name: 'Mr. Smitherson, is that correct?' This covers the polite patient address inquiry. All three elements are present in the conversation."
ELICITS SPECTRUM OF CONCERNS,4,"The physician begins by confirming the patient's main concern: 'I understand you've come in today because you're interested in quitting smoking. Is that correct?' The patient confirms this. The physician then asks, 'So besides your concern about quitting smoking, do you have any other things that you would like to speak about today?' The patient responds, 'No. That was pretty much it.' The physician acknowledges this and adds, 'If anything comes up, you can just stop me or just remember for later. Sound good?' This shows that the physician did ask if there were any other concerns but did not continue to probe further with a 'what else' question. Therefore, the physician elicited the main concern and made an effort to check for additional concerns, but did not fully ensure that all potential concerns were addressed."
NEGOTIATES PRIORITIES & SETS AGENDA,3,"The physician begins by confirming the patient's primary concern: 'I understand you've come in today because you're interested in quitting smoking. Is that correct?' The physician then outlines a plan: 'I'll start off by asking you questions about your current medical history, and then your past medical history, family history, social history. Get to know what you know about smoking and its effects on your body, and then we'll go through a plan. Does that sound like a good idea?' This shows an attempt to set an agenda. The physician also asks if there are any other concerns: 'So besides your concern about quitting smoking, do you have any other things that you would like to speak about today?' The patient responds, 'No. That was pretty much it.' The physician acknowledges this and leaves room for additional concerns: 'If anything comes up, you can just stop me or just remember for later. Sound good?' While the physician sets an agenda and confirms the patient's agreement, there is no negotiation of priorities since the patient only has one concern. Therefore, the physician does not need to list multiple concerns or negotiate their order."
ELICITING THE NARRATIVE THREAD or the ‘PATIENT’S STORY’,3,"The physician in this conversation generally allows the patient to talk about their problem but occasionally interrupts with focused questions. For example, the physician asks, 'So besides your concern about quitting smoking, do you have any other things that you would like to speak about today?' and then allows the patient to respond fully. However, there are moments where the physician interjects with specific questions, such as 'How many cigarettes do you smoke on a given day?' and 'Do you take any medications or any vitamins?' These interruptions are focused and relevant but do break the patient's narrative flow. Overall, the physician maintains a balance between letting the patient share their story and gathering necessary information."
TIMELINE,3,"The physician does obtain some information about the timeline of the patient's smoking history, but it is not comprehensive. The physician asks, 'With regards to your smoking, when exactly did you start smoking?' and the patient responds, 'I guess I started smoking soon after I started college... I was about 18.' This establishes the starting point. The physician also asks about the current smoking habit, 'How many cigarettes do you smoke on a given day?' and the patient responds, 'Well, now I smoke about half a pack a day.' However, the physician does not delve into the progression of the smoking habit over the years or any changes in the pattern of smoking. Additionally, the physician asks about past attempts to quit, 'Have you ever considered quitting in the past, or did you ever quit in the past?' and the patient provides some information about previous attempts. While this provides some context, it does not establish a complete chronology of the patient's smoking history and associated events. Therefore, the physician obtains some necessary information but fails to establish a complete chronology."
ORGANIZATION,N/A,"{
  ""explanation"": ""The physician's organization of the interview follows a logical order and covers all necessary aspects of the patient's history and current concerns. The conversation begins with the physician setting the agenda and confirming the patient's primary concern: quitting smoking.

For example, the physician asks, 'So in terms of your current health status, on a scale of 0 to 10, what would you rate it as?' and follows up with 'Are there any illnesses or medical conditions that you are currently experiencing?' This logical progression ensures that all relevant information is gathered efficiently.

The physician also effectively uses time by addressing the patient's concerns about quitting smoking, discussing potential triggers, and forming a plan. The conversation flows smoothly from one topic to another without any noticeable disjointed questions.

PACING OF INTERVIEW,5,"The interviewer demonstrates attentiveness and allows the patient to speak without frequent interruptions. For example, the physician says, 'All right. If anything comes up, you can just stop me or just remember for later. Sound good?' This shows a willingness to let the patient guide the conversation if needed. The interview progresses smoothly with logical transitions between topics, such as moving from medical history to social history and then to smoking habits. There are no awkward pauses, and the interviewer uses silence effectively, as seen when the physician says, 'Okay. So what makes you think it's going to work this time around?' and waits for the patient's response. Overall, the pacing is comfortable and deliberate."
QUESTIONING SKILLS – TYPES OF QUESTIONS,3,"The physician in this conversation often fails to start a line of inquiry with open-ended questions and relies heavily on specific or direct questions. For example, the physician begins with 'Hi. My name is Amy. Mr. Smitherson, is that correct?' and 'I understand you've come in today because you're interested in quitting smoking. Is that correct?' These are closed-ended questions. The physician continues with specific questions like 'How old are you, Tom?' and 'So besides your concern about quitting smoking, do you have any other things that you would like to speak about today?' While these questions are necessary, they do not open up the conversation for the patient to provide more detailed information. Additionally, the physician uses multiple questions in one go, such as 'Do you have any questions at this time or any other concerns you've thought of?' and 'Do you have any history of, besides the smoking, do you have any history of alcohol use or recreational drug use?' This can be confusing for the patient and may not yield comprehensive answers. The physician also uses leading questions like 'So what makes you think it's going to work this time around?' which can be perceived as judgmental. Overall, the conversation lacks the use of open-ended questions to start major lines of inquiry, and there are instances of multiple and leading questions."
QUESTIONING SKILLS - SUMMARIZING,3,"The physician summarizes the patient's history in a concise manner, covering key points such as the patient's lack of remarkable medical history, the father's diagnosis of lung cancer, the patient's use of vitamin D to improve mood, and the patient's occupation and lack of medical insurance. However, the summary is provided only once at the end and does not verify or clarify the information with the patient. The summary is also somewhat incomplete as it does not delve into any specific symptoms or other relevant details that might have been discussed. Therefore, while the summary is present, it is not comprehensive or interactive."
QUESTIONING SKILLS - DUPLICATION,5,No questions were duplicated.
QUESTIONING SKILLS - LACK OF JARGON,5,"The physician in this conversation uses language that is easily understood by the patient and avoids medical jargon. For example, the physician explains the mechanism of the medication in simple terms: 'What it does is it actually binds to the places where nicotine would bind in your brain, and it prevents nicotine from binding. So it kind of fulfills your cravings without you actually smoking.' This explanation avoids complex medical terminology and is clear and straightforward. Additionally, the physician provides practical advice in a clear manner, such as 'carry around gum with you or hard candy so you can put that in your mouth' and 'improving your diet, and also reducing caffeine intake.' The physician also ensures that the patient understands the support available, mentioning that Pfizer has a program to sponsor the prescription, which is explained in a way that is easy to understand. Overall, the physician's communication is clear, supportive, and avoids unnecessary medical jargon."
QUESTIONING SKILLS - VERIFICATION OF PATIENT INFORMATION (in vignette),5,"The physician in this conversation demonstrates a consistent effort to seek clarification, verification, and specificity of the patient's responses. For example, the physician asks, 'Can I ask you why you take that?' and follows up with 'Is there a particular reason?' to ensure understanding of the patient's motivations. The physician also probes for specifics about the patient's smoking habits with questions like 'When exactly did you start smoking?' and 'How many cigarettes do you smoke on a given day?' Additionally, the physician seeks to understand the patient's history and context by asking, 'Have you ever considered quitting in the past, or did you ever quit in the past?' and 'Do you currently live with them?' These questions show a clear effort to gather detailed and accurate information. The physician also verifies the patient's understanding and plans by asking, 'Would you be able to repeat back the plan that we've come up with?' and 'Do you have any questions or any other concerns?' This consistent approach to seeking clarification and specificity supports a high score."
VERBAL FACILITATION SKILLS,5,"The physician in this conversation consistently uses verbal encouragement and facilitation skills to engage the patient. The physician frequently uses short statements and echoing to draw out more information from the patient. For example, the physician says, 'Sorry to hear about that,' and 'I'm sure it has been difficult on you and your family,' which shows empathy and encourages the patient to share more. The physician also uses phrases like 'Sound good?' and 'Does that sound like something you would be able to do?' to ensure the patient is engaged and agrees with the plan. Additionally, the physician provides positive reinforcement, such as 'Seems like everything's kind of fitting into place,' and 'So you would essentially kill two birds with one stone by exercising and making your mind busy with that.' These statements help to motivate the patient and acknowledge their efforts. Overall, the physician's consistent use of facilitative skills and verbal encouragement throughout the conversation merits a high score."

Overall, the physician uses supportive comments and demonstrates empathy effectively."
PATIENT’S PERSPECTIVE (BELIEFS; Case specific),3,"The physician in this conversation does a good job of eliciting the patient's perspective on their health and smoking habits. The physician asks open-ended questions such as, 'Is there a particular reason?' and 'Is there anything in particular that triggers you to start smoking?' which allows the patient to share their thoughts and feelings. The patient discusses their stress and the recent diagnosis of their father with lung cancer, which the physician acknowledges and uses to motivate the patient. The physician also addresses the patient's concerns about the medication and potential weight gain, providing detailed explanations and reassurance. However, the physician does not fully explore the patient's beliefs about the beginning of their smoking habit or their expectations for the treatment beyond hoping it will work. Therefore, while the physician elicits some of the patient's perspective, they do not fully address all aspects of the patient's beliefs and expectations."
IMPACT OF ILLNESS ON PATIENT AND PATIENT’S SELF-IMAGE,N/A,N/A
ACHIEVE A SHARED PLAN,5,"The physician thoroughly discusses the plan for quitting smoking with the patient, including setting a quit date, removing smoking-related items, informing family and friends, and using medication (Chantix). The physician also addresses the patient's concerns about weight gain and the possibility of the plan not working. Throughout the conversation, the physician invites the patient to contribute their thoughts and preferences. For example, the physician asks, 'Do you have anything in mind in particular?' and 'Does that sound like something you would be able to do?' The patient actively participates in the discussion, expressing their concerns and preferences, such as preferring Chantix because it worked for their parents. The physician also reassures the patient by discussing alternative options if the initial plan does not work and offers continuous support. This collaborative approach and thorough discussion of the plan and potential outcomes align with the criteria for a high score."
ENCOURAGEMENT OF QUESTIONS,5,"The physician provides multiple opportunities for the patient to ask questions or bring up additional concerns. The first opportunity is given with the statement, 'Do you have any questions at this time or any other concerns you've thought of?' This is followed by another opportunity, 'Any questions or any other concerns?' and 'Any questions? Any other concerns?' The physician continues to encourage questions with, 'Do you have any questions in the end, or is this any other concerns?' Finally, the physician concludes with, 'So we'll definitely follow up with you. And if you have any questions before the follow-up visit after about three weeks, then you can definitely come in or you can call.' This consistent encouragement throughout the conversation, including at the end, ensures the patient has ample opportunity to ask questions or bring up additional topics."
SUPPORT SYSTEMS,N/A,"{
  ""explanation"": ""The interviewer begins by exploring the patient's emotional support system, asking, 'So who really serves as your social support? Would you say it's your parents, or do you have friends in the area?' The patient responds that their parents are their main support since they live at home. The interviewer acknowledges this and suggests involving the parents in the patient's efforts to quit smoking, saying, 'So it's a really good idea to get their support in your efforts. So tell them that you're going to quit smoking, and I'm sure they'll support you considering they themselves quit smoking.' This shows a good understanding of the patient's emotional support system.

The interviewer also addresses the patient's financial situation by asking, 'Do you have insurance through your job?' and noting the patient's lack of insurance. The interviewer then provides a potential solution by mentioning Pfizer's program that can sponsor the prescription, taking into account the patient's financial hardship: 'Pfizer actually has a program where they can actually sponsor the prescription for you. So they'll pay everything.'

However, the interviewer does not explore other community resources or support groups that might be beneficial for the patient beyond the Pfizer program. While the interviewer does a good job of addressing the patient's emotional and financial support, they do not fully explore or suggest additional resources.

Therefore, the interviewer determines some aspects of the available support but does not fully explore or suggest resources, which aligns with a score of 3."",

PATIENT’S EDUCATION & UNDERSTANDING,5,"The physician effectively determines the patient's level of interest and provides appropriate education throughout the conversation. The physician asks the patient about their knowledge of smoking effects: 'So do you know the effects of smoking on your body and what it can do potentially?' The patient responds with their understanding, and the physician confirms and expands on it. The physician also uses the teach-back technique effectively by asking the patient to repeat the plan: 'Would you be able to repeat back the plan that we've come up with?' The patient successfully repeats the plan, demonstrating understanding. Additionally, the physician addresses the patient's concerns about weight gain and the effectiveness of the medication, providing reassurance and a plan for follow-up: 'Studies have actually shown that Shantix is a very effective therapy.

OPENING,3,"The physician introduces herself with 'Hi, I'm Brianna,' which is a basic self-introduction but lacks role clarification. There is no polite inquiry about how to address the patient by name. The conversation then moves directly to 'What brings you in today?' without further context."
ELICITS SPECTRUM OF CONCERNS,5,"The physician begins by asking, 'What brings you in today?' which prompts the patient to express their main concern about chest pain and potential heart issues. The physician then follows up with, 'Is there anything else that brought you in today?' which allows the patient to mention their concern about how their heart condition might impact their job. The physician acknowledges these concerns and asks, 'Is there anything else you'd like to talk about today before we move on?' The patient responds with, 'No, that's it.' This sequence shows that the physician effectively elicited the patient's full spectrum of concerns by asking follow-up questions until no additional concerns were raised."
NEGOTIATES PRIORITIES & SETS AGENDA,5,"The physician begins by summarizing the patient's concerns: 'Okay. So you're concerned about your chest pain. You're concerned about your heart. You're also concerned about your job. Okay. Is there anything else you'd like to talk about today before we move on?' This shows an effort to elicit all of the patient's concerns. The physician then sets an agenda by stating, 'So I'll just ask a little bit about your chest pain, and then we'll get some information that will help me assess your risk of heart disease since it sounds like you're concerned about that, and then we'll find out a little bit about your job.' Finally, the physician seeks the patient's agreement: 'Is that okay?' The patient responds affirmatively with 'Sure.' This demonstrates that the physician has listed all concerns, set a comprehensive agenda, and negotiated priorities with the patient."
ELICITING THE NARRATIVE THREAD or the ‘PATIENT’S STORY’,3,"The physician in this conversation generally allows the patient to talk but occasionally interrupts with focused questions. For example, the physician starts with an open-ended question: 'What brings you in today?' and follows up with 'Is there anything else that brought you in today?' This encourages the patient to share more details. However, the physician also interjects with specific questions like 'What were you doing at the time when your chest pain started?' and 'Do you usually mountain bike at night?' which can interrupt the patient's narrative flow. The physician does a good job of summarizing and reflecting back what the patient says, such as 'So you were mountain biking, and you fell off, you hit your chest.' This shows active listening but still maintains a Q&A style rather than a completely open narrative thread."
TIMELINE,5,"The physician does a thorough job of establishing a timeline and history of the present illness. The conversation begins with the physician asking when the chest pain started: 'So why don't you tell me about when your chest pain started.' The patient responds with a specific timeframe: 'About two nights ago.' The physician then inquires about the activity at the time of onset: 'What were you doing at the time when your chest pain started?' The patient provides context: 'I was mountain biking, and I ended up falling off and hit myself, but right here in my chest.' The physician confirms the timeline and the event: 'So it started two nights ago when you were mountain biking and you hit your chest on the handles.' The physician continues to gather information on the progression of the pain: 'And tell me how it's been since that point.' The patient describes the pain's evolution: 'Yesterday it was more severe, the pain. And it hasn't gone away yet.' The physician further explores the nature of the pain: 'Can you tell me about what the pain feels like to you?' and 'Okay, so it's always there?' The patient provides details on the pain's characteristics and triggers: 'It's like an aching pain that's always there,' 'No, there's a sharpness that will come sometimes when I move,' and 'Yeah, especially I tried reaching for a jar of peanut butter that's about this high in my kitchen, and that was tough.' The physician also asks about alleviating factors: 'Anything that makes your pain better?' and the patient responds: 'I've been taking some Advil, and that's helped, and just staying still.' Finally, the physician inquires about associated symptoms: 'Any other symptoms associated with the pain?' and the patient confirms: 'No.' Overall, the physician successfully establishes a clear chronology and history of the present illness."
ORGANIZATION,5,"The physician's organization of the interview is quite logical and follows a clear structure. The physician starts by identifying the patient's main concerns: chest pain, heart health, and job impact. The physician then systematically explores the chest pain by asking about its onset, activities at the time, and characteristics of the pain. For example, the physician asks, 'So why don't you tell me about when your chest pain started?' and 'Can you tell me about what the pain feels like to you?' This is followed by questions about the patient's medical history, family history, and social history, which are relevant to assessing heart disease risk. The physician also addresses the patient's concerns about work and offers to provide a work excuse if needed. The conversation flows logically from one topic to another without any disjointed questions, ensuring that all relevant information is gathered efficiently. Therefore, the interview is well-organized and makes effective use of time."
PACING OF INTERVIEW,5,"The interviewer in this conversation demonstrates a high level of attentiveness and allows the patient to fully express their concerns without interruption. For example, the physician listens to the patient's detailed account of the mountain biking accident and their drinking habits without cutting them off. The interview progresses smoothly, with the physician asking follow-up questions that are relevant and build on the patient's previous responses, such as, 'So it started two nights ago when you were mountain biking and you hit your chest on the handles. And tell me how it's been since that point.' There are no awkward pauses, and the use of silence is deliberate, allowing the patient to provide comprehensive answers. The physician also summarizes the patient's concerns and provides reassurance, which helps maintain a smooth flow: 'So it sounds like your chest pain is probably related to the mountain biking accident, and we talked about getting you a note for work.' Overall, the pacing of the interview is comfortable and effective."
QUESTIONING SKILLS – TYPES OF QUESTIONS,N/A,"{
  ""explanation"": ""The physician begins the conversation with an open-ended question: 'What brings you in today?' This is a good start as it allows the patient to provide a broad overview of their concerns. The physician continues with another open-ended question: 'Is there anything else that brought you in today?' which further encourages the patient to share more information. 

  However, the physician then shifts to more specific questions without always starting new lines of inquiry with open-ended questions. For example, 'Did you injure any other part of your body during the accident?' and 'Were you wearing a helmet?' are specific questions that could have been preceded by a more open-ended question about the accident itself. 

  The physician also uses some leading questions, such as 'Do you feel like you were drunk or feeling the effects of the alcohol at the time of the accident?' which could influence the patient's response. 

  Additionally, the physician asks multiple questions in a single turn, such as 'Do you know if she had type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes?' and 'Do you know if she takes any medications for the diabetes?' This can be confusing for the patient and may lead to incomplete answers.

  Despite these issues, the physician does return to open-ended questions at times, such as 'Can you tell me about any ongoing medical problems that you might have?' and 'Can you tell me a little bit about your work?' These questions help gather more comprehensive information.

  Overall, while the physician does use some open-ended questions effectively, there is a reliance on specific and leading questions, and multiple questions are used at times. This detracts from the quality of information gathered."",

QUESTIONING SKILLS - SUMMARIZING,5,"The physician does a good job of summarizing the patient's concerns and the data obtained during the interview. The physician states, 'So you're concerned about your chest pain. You're concerned about your heart. You're also concerned about your job. Okay. Is there anything else you'd like to talk about today before we move on?' This shows that the physician is summarizing the patient's concerns to ensure all issues are addressed. Additionally, the physician summarizes the potential causes and risks by saying, 'So it sounds like your chest pain is probably related to the mountain biking accident, and we talked about getting you a note for work. And based on what I've heard from your history, it sounds like at your age and with the lifestyle you have, you're not at a terrible risk for heart disease at this time, but making some changes with cutting out alcohol and smoking, I think that that would definitely decrease your risks of heart disease in the future.' This summary is comprehensive and covers the major points discussed, including the chest pain, job concerns, and lifestyle factors affecting heart disease risk."
QUESTIONING SKILLS - DUPLICATION,5,No questions were duplicated.
QUESTIONING SKILLS - LACK OF JARGON,5,"The physician consistently uses language that is easily understood by the patient and avoids medical jargon. For example, the physician says, 'So I'll just ask a little bit about your chest pain, and then we'll get some information that will help me assess your risk of heart disease,' which is clear and straightforward. When discussing the patient's concerns about heart health, the physician explains, '...making some changes with cutting out alcohol and smoking, I think that that would definitely decrease your risks of heart disease in the future,' which is also clear and avoids complex medical terminology. Additionally, the physician provides explanations when necessary, such as when discussing the patient's mother's heart surgery: 'So some things that cause people to get heart surgery people are born with. Other things that cause a need for heart surgery are a result of disease that you get when you're going along and have lifestyle issues or any diseases.' This explanation is clear and avoids jargon, making it accessible to the patient."
QUESTIONING SKILLS - VERIFICATION OF PATIENT INFORMATION (in vignette),5,"The physician in this conversation consistently seeks to clarify, verify, and specify the patient's responses, ensuring accurate understanding. For example, the physician asks, 'What were you doing at the time when your chest pain started?' and follows up with specific questions about the circumstances, such as 'Did you injure any other part of your body during the accident?' and 'Were you wearing a helmet?' This shows a thorough approach to understanding the context of the chest pain. Additionally, the physician probes into the patient's alcohol consumption with questions like 'And how much had you had to drink before you rode your mountain bike?' and 'Do you feel like you were drunk or feeling the effects of the alcohol at the time of the accident?' This level of detail helps in assessing the patient's condition accurately. The physician also explores the nature of the pain with questions like 'Can you tell me about what the pain feels like to you?' and 'Anything else that makes the pain worse?' This demonstrates a consistent effort to clarify and verify the patient's symptoms. Overall, the physician's approach aligns well with the criteria for a high score."
VERBAL FACILITATION SKILLS,5,"The physician in this conversation demonstrates a consistent use of verbal encouragement and facilitation skills to engage the patient. The physician acknowledges the patient's concerns and provides reassurance, as seen in statements like 'Well, I'm glad you came in.' and 'Good. Well, I'm glad to hear that you're wearing a helmet.' The physician also uses short statements to guide the conversation and draw out more information, such as 'Okay. So I'll just ask a little bit about your chest pain...' and 'Does that sound okay?' Additionally, the physician offers praise and constructive feedback, 'So, you know, I might recommend that you try and drink fewer beers in one sitting. Does that sound like something you would consider?' and 'So smoking is another thing that if you feel like your heart health is a priority, that's something that you could change in your life. Do you think that's something you would consider?' These examples show that the physician is actively engaging the patient and encouraging them to share more about their health and lifestyle, which aligns with the criteria for a high score."
EMPATHY AND ACKNOWLEDGING PATIENT CUES,5,"The physician demonstrates empathy and support in several parts of the conversation. For example, the physician says, 'Well, I'm glad you came in,' which acknowledges the patient's effort to seek medical help. Additionally, the physician reassures the patient by saying, 'Good. Well, I'm glad to hear that you're wearing a helmet,' which shows concern for the patient's safety. The physician also offers to help with a work excuse, saying, 'I would be more than happy to speak with my preceptor and see if we can get a work excuse for you so you can have some recovery time,' which demonstrates support for the patient's need for recovery. Furthermore, the physician provides reassurance about the patient's risk for heart disease, stating, 'I don't think that your mom's history is something that will impact you even though the two of you are related.' These comments collectively show understanding, respect, and support for the patient's situation."
PATIENT’S PERSPECTIVE (BELIEFS; Case specific),3,"The physician does provide the patient with opportunities to ask questions or bring up additional topics. For example, the physician asks, 'Do you have any questions about what we've talked about?' and 'Any other questions that you have?' These questions invite the patient to share any concerns or additional topics they might want to discuss. However, the physician does not deeply explore the patient's beliefs, feelings, ideas of cause, function, and expectations (FIFE) regarding the chest pain and potential heart issues. The conversation does touch on the patient's concerns about their heart and job, but it does not delve deeply into the patient's perspective on these issues. Therefore, the physician elicits some of the patient's perspective but does not fully address their beliefs."
IMPACT OF ILLNESS ON PATIENT AND PATIENT’S SELF-IMAGE,3,"The physician acknowledges the patient's concerns about their heart and job, asking, 'Are you concerned about returning to work?' This shows some recognition of the impact on the patient's life. However, the physician does not delve deeper into how the illness affects the patient's self-image or daily activities. The offer to speak with a preceptor about a work excuse is helpful but does not fully explore the emotional or psychological impact of the illness. Therefore, the physician partially addresses the impact but does not offer counseling or additional resources."
ACHIEVE A SHARED PLAN,3,"The physician does discuss the diagnosis and prognosis with the patient. For example, the physician states, 'So it sounds like your chest pain is probably related to the mountain biking accident,' and 'Based on what I've heard from your history, it sounds like at your age and with the lifestyle you have, you're not at a terrible risk for heart disease at this time.' The physician also provides recommendations for lifestyle changes, such as reducing alcohol consumption and smoking, which are part of the plan to decrease future risks of heart disease. However, the physician does not explicitly invite the patient to contribute their own thoughts, ideas, suggestions, or preferences regarding the plan. The conversation is more directive than collaborative, which lacks the full quality of a higher score."
ENCOURAGEMENT OF QUESTIONS,2,"The physician initially asks the patient if they have any questions about what was discussed, which is a positive step. However, when the patient expresses a concern about their family history of heart surgery, the physician does not address the concern and instead asks if there are any other questions. This response can be seen as dismissive and does not encourage further discussion or questions. The physician does not provide a thorough opportunity for the patient to bring up additional topics or points not covered in the interview. Therefore, the interaction does not meet the criteria for a higher score."
SUPPORT SYSTEMS,1,"The physician did not discuss any aspects of the patient's support systems. There were no questions or comments about the patient's emotional support, financial support, or access to healthcare. The physician also did not suggest any community resources or other forms of assistance. Therefore, the physician failed to determine or discuss any support currently available to the patient."
PATIENT’S EDUCATION & UNDERSTANDING,3,"The physician does a good job of determining the patient's level of interest and providing appropriate education. For example, the physician addresses the patient's concerns about heart health and the impact of alcohol and smoking: 'So, you know, I might recommend that you try and drink fewer beers in one sitting. Does that sound like something you would consider?' and 'So smoking is another thing that if you feel like your heart health is a priority, that's something that you could change in your life. Do you think that's something you would consider?' However, the physician does not use the teach back technique to ensure understanding. The physician does ask if the patient has any questions: 'Do you have any questions about what we've talked about?' but does not ask the patient to repeat the information or demonstrate understanding. Therefore, the physician's approach aligns more closely with a score of 3."
ASSESS MOTIVATION FOR CHANGES,3,"The physician begins by addressing the patient's drinking habits and suggests reducing the number of beers in one sitting, asking, 'Does that sound like something you would consider?' This shows an attempt to gauge the patient's willingness to change. When the patient mentions their concern about a potential heart injury and their mother's history, the physician acknowledges this and shifts the conversation to smoking, another risk factor for heart health. The physician asks, 'Do you think that's something you would consider?' regarding quitting smoking. This indicates that the physician is trying to assess the patient's motivation for change and provide appropriate support and options. However, the physician does not delve deeply into the patient's feelings or readiness for these changes, nor do they offer a detailed plan or follow-up steps."
CLOSURE,3,"The physician provides some details about the immediate next steps but lacks comprehensive information about future plans. The physician says, 'I'll go talk with my preceptor, and you can wait here, change into a gown, and we'll be back in just a few minutes to do your physical exam.' This specifies what the physician will do (talk with the preceptor) and what the patient will do (wait and change into a gown). However, it does not provide information about any further steps beyond the immediate next few minutes, such as follow-up appointments or additional instructions. Therefore, the plan is only partially detailed."
